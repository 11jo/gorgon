# The Gorgon's Eye
A mod for BG:EE that adds a thieves guild into the town of Beregost.
<h2>Prequel</h2>
<p>After violating the terms of his separation from the Shadow Thieves, Baldwin
"The Butcher" Glendale, fled north to Beregost, where he formed his own guild,
the Gorgon's Eye. He pressed the local pickpockets and began amassing a vast
network of contacts and spies. The townspeople have begun to show signs of
unrest, however, and are making plans of their own to combat this new threat.
On top of that, the impending confrontation with the Shadow Thieves lies near
on the horizon. Currently, Baldwin is in active recruitment, seeking
adventurers to aid him in the search for a dark and powerful staff called the
Kerykeion. If successful, it would grant him unimaginable power, allowing
nothing to stand in his way.</p>

<h2>Mod Overview</h2>
<p>The Gorgon's Eye is a small content mod for BG:EE/SoD and EET that adds an
underground thieves den into the town of Beregost. It contains 20 new quests,
2 new areas(reused), dozens of new characters, a new store that buys stolen
goods, a few new items and a very small item-upgrade. It can be accessed
immediately after leaving Candlekeep and is open to all players, excluding
those with a lawful-good alignment.</p>

<p>The component "Add more pickpocketable items" will distribute random treasure to
almost every generic npc. (Commoners, nobles, etc.)</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>This mod would not have been possible without DnD Detective's mod tutorial 
videos on YouTube. They really helped me bridge the gap between knowing
absolutely nothing about how to start a mod, to being able to create working
content. I also want to give a special thanks to CamDawg and the entire G3 community,
who answered and provided reference for all my questions.</p>
