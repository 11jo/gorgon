@1000 = ~Oh, my, you startled me! Please, I don't mean any rudeness, but I wish to be left alone.~
@1001 = ~Don't be alarmed, Aisha. I know about the bounty and I'm just here to find out why someone would want you dead.~
@1002 = ~I'm here to collect your bounty, Aisha. Let's not make this harder than it needs to be.~
@1003 = ~Wait! Please let me explain before you make your judgement!~
@1004 = ~Fine, I'll listen to what you have to say.~
@1005 = ~Sorry, but I don't have time for this. (Snap her neck.)~
@1006 = ~It was that fool Amrius who placed it on me! He tried to force himself upon me after I denied his clumsy, drunken advances.~
@1007 = ~I tried to fight back, but he was too strong. When he was trying to carry me out of the tavern, he lost his balance and collapsed into one of the tables.~
@1008 = ~He was covered in food, drink and blood from something cutting his face. Everyone around him saw and laughed. I took the opportunity to flee as fast as I could.~
@1009 = ~The next day I learned he placed a bounty on me and I've been hiding out here ever since.~
@1010 = ~Where can I find this Amrius? Maybe I can convince him to remove the bounty.~
@1011 = ~Sorry Aisha, but I have a job to do. (Snap her neck.)~
@1012 = ~Really? You would do that for me? Th-thank you! I know he frequents The Burning Wizard fairly often, so he could be staying there.~
@1013 = ~You're back! Did you end up speaking with Amrius?~
@1014 = ~Yes, you don't have to worry about him anymore.~
@1015 = ~Not yet, I'll be heading there shortly.~
@1016 = ~I've decided to just kill you and collect the bounty.~
@1017 = ~Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much! Here, I don't have much gold, but hopefully this necklace will be a suitable reward.~
@1018 = ~No! Stay back!~
@1019 = ~Thanks again for helping me. I wish there was more I could do to repay you.~

//h_amriud.d......@1200 - @1399

@1200 = ~Bugger off. I don't know you and I don't care to.~
@1201 = ~I'll be going now.~
@1202 = ~I'm here regarding the bounty on Aisha.~
@1203 = ~Unfortunate bit of business that is. As you can tell by my face though, she deserves whatever's coming to her.~
@1204 = ~She said she was only defending herself from you, and that you fell because you were drunk.~
@1205 = ~She would say anything to dissuade her attacker. She assaulted me, ask anybody in there. She pushed me into the table, cut my face and made me look an utter fool.~
@1206 = ~I want you to remove the bounty, she doesn't deserve to die.~
@1207 = ~If you don't remove the bounty, then I'll just kill you instead!~
@1208 = ~Is there anything I can do to make you reconsider?~
@1209 = ~After observing your condition, I tend to agree with you. I found Aisha next door at the Red Sheaf and I think I'll go pay her another visit.~
@1210 = ~Why would I do that? She dishonered and embarrassed me in front of the whole tavern.~
@1211 = ~Bring it on then! I ain't afraid of you!~
@1212 = ~I'll remove the bounty for 300 gold coins. That amount would ease my ego enough to move on.~
@1213 = ~I'll be back with the money.~
@1214 = ~Here take the coin then. I'll go inform Aisha.~
@1215 = ~Yeah, you do that.~
@1216 = ~Alright, fine. I wouldn't be able to win a fight in my current condition, anyway. As long as she doesn't show her face near me again, there won't be a problem.~
@1217 = ~Excellent, I could tell you were a person of reason.~
@1218 = ~You again, what is it you want now?~
@1219 = ~I want you to remove the bounty, Aisha doesn't deserve to die.~
@1220 = ~Nothing, I'll be going now.~
@1221 = ~I've got nothin' to say to you.~

//h_ariosd.d......@1400 - @1599

@1400 = ~We used to run these streets alone until Baldwin showed up. Got us set up with his guild and straightened us out real quick. Now we're taking twice the coin with half the risk!~
@1401 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>. We're on orders to await your signal. Are we ready to make our move?~
@1402 = ~Yes, I've secured all their weapons. Divy them up and ready yourselves for action.~
@1403 = ~Not yet. I'm just reporting in. I'll be heading down presently, so be on alert.~
@1404 = ~What was I supposed to do again?~
@1405 = ~Roger that. Alright you men! You heard the lass. Stand fast until she returns with the weapons.~
@1406 = ~Roger that. Alright you men! You heard the lad. Stand fast until he returns with the weapons.~
@1407 = ~Gods, what was Rigaldo thinking sending us a rookie for this mission. Go inside those tents there and steal the weapons off every gamesman inside, then bring them back to us. We will take it from there.~
@1408 = ~Back already? Whats the word then?~
@1409 = ~I've secured all their weapons. Divy them up and ready yourselves for action.~
@1410 = ~Nothing yet. I'm heading down now.~
@1411 = ~Aye! Come on you men, take your weapons and let's move out!~
@1412 = ~Welcome back, boss.~
@1413 = ~Baldwin! The Shadow Thieves have infiltrated the city! A dozen of their rank fight above us as we speak!~
@1414 = ~Scores remain outside Beregost with Thamuz at its helm! They will be here by nightfall!~
@1415 = ~So, they finally decided to make their move now, have they? Men! Ready your stations and prepare for battle!~
@1416 = ~Ariosh! Mount the outer fortifications and activate the traps at the city's edge.~
@1417 = ~Yes, sir!~
@1418 = ~Rhade! Distribute our munitions throughout the guild. Send word to the Night Masks and any mercenaries willing to fight for coin. We'll need as many soldiers as we can get after tonight's bloodshed.~
@1419 = ~Roger that.~
@1420 = ~Rigaldo! Call our numbers back from duty and get your men on the grindstone.~
@1421 = ~Aye!~
@1422 = ~Mifune, I will need you to take care of the Shadow Thieves within the city while we prepare for the incoming siege.~
@1423 = ~Grab your guild armaments and then head out. Report back to me when you have exterminated all the vermin from the city.~

//h_asnabd.d......@1600 - @1799

@1600 = ~If I don't get rid of that damn dryad soon we might just have to pack it up and head home. She raided our camp again last night and destroyed half our supplies.~
@1601 = ~You wouldn't be here on our behalf now would you? I offered a reward for the removal of this witch, Katreda, but so far none have answered the call.~
@1602 = ~I have just finished speaking with Katreda and I have decided to help her. Take your men and go. Find another wood to build your lodge in.~
@1603 = ~Katreda has offered me a more substantial reward. You'll have to do better if you want my help.~
@1604 = ~Why in gods name would you help that... fiendish creature!~
@1605 = ~Bah! You bounty hunter scum are all the same!~
@1606 = ~Normally, I would despise killing anything without conducting a proper chase, but now I tire of these games.~
@1607 = ~I'll deal with the dryad myself after I finish with you lot. You see, these weapons aren't just for hunting boar!~

//h_bald2d.d......@1800 - @1999

@1800 = ~It is done. The final piece of the Kerykeion is finally in my possession!~
@1801 = ~Thank you for your assistance, <CHARNAME>. Your help has been nothing short of invaluable to me.~
@1802 = ~Of course, Baldwin. How do we proceed from here?~
@1803 = ~I cannot let you continue with this. I have been warned of the dangers this weapon will bring and it must be destroyed!~
@1804 = ~You are alone, Baldwin, and have all the pieces laid out in front of you, yet, it still remains disassembled. I think I shall kill you and take it for myself!~
@1805 = ~I will be leaving the guild to begin my crusade into Amn, where I will use the Kerykeion to eliminate the Shadow Thieves from this world.~
@1806 = ~The Gorgon's Eye will need a new leader, of course, and I plan to leave it under your directive. You have shown great promise in this field and I believe you the most capable for this task.~
@1807 = ~Speak with Saradin upon your return and he will guide you through the activities of your new role.~
@1808 = ~Destroyed? You poor, ignorant fool. I have toiled for years to obtain this staff and I'll not have those efforts wasted on your baseless fears.~
@1809 = ~Treason is it? I guess I cannot blame you, with the opportunity for such power being within your sight.~
@1810 = ~If this is your wish then now is your chance to strike. I must warn you though, I have no plans of dying today. Taking your life will be a testament of my strength, proving my worthiness to wield the Kerykeion!~
@1811 = ~Hold... We are not alone.~
@1812 = ~Evening, Gerard. I suspect you understand the reason for my visit.~
@1813 = ~Absolutely not. What is the meaning of this intrusion? I demand you leave my premises at once!~
@1814 = ~Sorry, but that won't be happening. Hiring the Shadow Thieves against us was a deadly mistake.~
@1815 = ~Hand over the Kerykeion and I shall reward you with a quick death. Refuse and you will learn how I received of my namesake.~
@1816 = ~Kill me if you must, Butcher. But let it be known that I will no longer suffer your indignities any longer.~
@1817 = ~If that is your wish, then so be it.~

//h_baldwd.d......@2000 - @2199

@2000 = ~I think you've stumbled into the wrong place, friend. I'm sure there's a cat stuck in a tree somewhere that requires your aid. Now, begone from me. Your sanctimonious bullshit disgusts me.~
@2001 = ~Only a fool would approach one such as me unannounced. Tradition would have you killed for such a disturbance but, oh... wait. I know of this one... <CHARNAME>, is it?~
@2002 = ~Another assassin then? You're not the first to threaten my life only to forfeit their own.~
@2003 = ~How is it that you know my name? Who are you?~
@2004 = ~<CHARNAME>? Never heard of 'em. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be going.~
@2005 = ~You can lower your weapons, no need to be alarmed. I am not your enemy. At least I don't have to be.~
@2006 = ~I make it my business to know who wanders about the city, and you are but one of many.~
@2007 = ~I am Baldwin, and you have found yourself in the den of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2008 = ~It may not appear much, but appearances are meant to deceive. Rest assured, our operations run throughout all quarters south of the gate.~
@2009 = ~Now then, if I recall, there is a rather large bounty on your head, and yet here you stand surrounded by my cutthroats and hunters.~
@2010 = ~I could have you killed at the snap of my fingers, collect my reward and I would think nothing of it. However, I believe your abilities may prove to be worth just a bit more.~
@2011 = ~I extend an offer for you to join us, if ambition and coin be your interest.~
@2012 = ~I thought Ravenscar controlled the whole of the Sword Coast.~
@2013 = ~What could I expect to gain from joining your guild?~
@2014 = ~What types of tasks would be required of me?~
@2015 = ~I accept your offer and look forward to the opportunities it will provide.~
@2016 = ~I'm not sure if I can trust you, but if the coin is good then I accept.~
@2017 = ~I don't think I'm interested in working for a bunch of thieves.~
@2018 = ~Oh my, quite a surprise you would be so informed. A refreshing contrast to the usual drab I am forced to deal with. Ravenscar's influence does leave the walls yes, to be sure, but his jurisdiction stays within.~
@2019 = ~What of the Shadows Thieves? We are not far from Amn.~
@2020 = ~Linvail's dogs don't typically sniff around this far north. I have staked my claim to this territory and none have sent challenge.~
@2021 = ~I offer you an opportunity to gain unique skills in the sneaksman's trade from some of the finest theives in Faerun. You would be armed and trained, and recieve a cut from the guilds earnings.~
@2022 = ~Your duties would include pickpocketing and extorting targets for selected possessions. Some of your missions may require stealth to obtain sensitive information, while others may require a more brutish approach.~
@2023 = ~Hmm, I see. As you were then.~
@2024 = ~<CHARNAME>, you've returned. Have you reconsidered my offer then?~
@2025 = ~Though I am skeptical of your nature, I have decided I would like to join your guild.~
@2026 = ~No, I have no desire to work with a bunch of thieves.~
@2027 = ~Excellent, welcome aboard then! Make yourself at home and all that. Or don't. It matters little to me.~
@2121 = ~Rigaldo will be in charge of directing your assignments within the guild. Off with you now though, as I must attend to my duties.~
@2028 = ~Why do you disturb me further?~
@2029 = ~How did you know my name? Who are you?~
@2030 = ~I'll be leaving now~
@2031 = ~No time to chat, I'm afraid. Attend to your regular duties unless instructed otherwise.~
@2032 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Just the person I wanted to see. Rigaldo tells me you are doing fine work, and I think it is time I filled you in on some official guild business.~
@2033 = ~A network of elite spies under my employ, whom I refer to as my Snake Heads, are investigating the location of an ancient staff called the Kerykeion.~
@2034 = ~We believe that it was brought to Faerun during the Time of Troubles, but was destroyed in some ghastly battle.~
@2035 = ~Most historians have viewed it as myth, but I believe they just lack the sort of... curiousity that people in our profession find themselves with.~
@2036 = ~Now, as it so happens, we have devised a way to reassemble the staff and restore its power.~
@2037 = ~I needn't bore you with the details, but rest assured this will be a demanding campaign, requiring considerable efforts on all fronts.~
@2038 = ~What more can you tell me about the staff?~
@2039 = ~What condition do you believe the staff to be in?~
@2040 = ~What is it that you would have me do?~
@2041 = ~It is a weapon of unprecedented power created long ago in the depths of the Underworld.~
@2042 = ~Saradin ponders his theories about its history and would be happy to delve into its details. If you're curious about it, feel free to ask him.~
@2043 = ~We believe that it was seperated into 3 fragments, each containing the essence of a different Gorgon Sister.~
@2044 = ~Ok... and who are the Gorgon Sisters?~
@2045 = ~The Gorgon Sisters were ancient and powerful snake-like beings who were responsible for the creation of the Kerykeion. Saradin can tell you more, if you are interested.~
@2046 = ~I would like you to aid me in the collection of its parts.~
@2047 = ~There are whispers of a witch practicing dark magic atop the highest peak in the Gibberling Mountains. Tales of deafening screams and auras of green light filling its night sky.~
@2048 = ~We believe she has found a part of the staff and has somehow managed to unleash its power.~
@2049 = ~I am sending you to find this witch. If it is in her possession then you have my full authority to retrieve it by any means necessary.~
@2050 = ~What type of reward can I expect?~
@2051 = ~I will go locate this mage and bring back the piece if she has it.~
@2052 = ~While I do have something in mind, depending on your success, you should not *expect* anything for carrying out your required duties.~
@2053 = ~Aye, it's settled then. Return to me when you have finished your duty.~
@2054 = ~<CHARNAME>, you've returned. Were you able to locate this mage? Tell me, was she in possession of the staff?~
@2055 = ~She was. However, we may not be the only ones searching for the Kerykeion. It seems there were some other thieves who attacked her before I arrived.~
@2056 = ~I have a few other things I need to do first.~
@2057 = ~That is curious indeed. None but our own should have known of this endeavor.~
@2058 = ~Listen carefully. I have sensed something... ominous here of late. Movement in the shadows that is not our own. Eyes in the city that do not belong.~
@2059 = ~With the addition of your report, I can only conclude that we are being watched. By who, I am unsure.~
@2060 = ~Going forward, be on your guard while about the city. I will have my spies investigate further.~
@2061 = ~At any rate, we were able to obtain what they could not. Strength may be on our side. Excellent work, <CHARNAME>.~
@2062 = ~Here is your reward. A ring I picked up from my days in Athkatla. I will send word when new information on the Kerykeion becomes available. If you'll excuse me, I have some pressing business to attend to.~
@2063 = ~<CHARNAME>! Go to the surface and eliminate all the Shadow Thieves from the city.~
@2064 = ~Ariosh mentioned Thamuz was leading their offensive, do you know who he is?~
@2065 = ~I have found these reports among the dead, but it's written in a code that I cannot decipher.~
@2066 = ~Understood.~
@2067 = ~Aye. Thamuz and I were comrades once. He is a dangerous rogue who has mastered the arts of stealth and deception. He should not be underestimated.~
@2068 = ~Why have they decided to attack us now?~
@2069 = ~This is their first attempt against me since I left Amn, many years ago. They have been hunting me for years, yet I fear the timing of their attack alludes me.~
@2070 = ~It could be immediate retaliation for our excerise at the carnival. Although, the more likely conclusion is that they have become aware of our movements toward the Kerykeion, and wish to stop us.~
@2071 = ~Regardless, we have more pressing matters at hand and should leave these theories for another time. Is there anything else you need?~
@2072 = ~No, that is all.~
@2073 = ~Let me see that!~
@2074 = ~...~
@2075 = ~Belay those orders! The attack was a feint! Their main force is heading north towards the Wood of Sharp Teeth!~
@2076 = ~It appears they are planning negotiations with a group of smugglers for the purchase of a Kerykeion piece! Dammit, those bastards have been one step ahead of us this whole time!~
@2077 = ~<CHARNAME>, I need you to head north immediately. They are meeting with a rogue named Nagate, near some old elven ruins.~
@2078 = ~Be on your guard when you arrive. It seems the Shadow Thieves had their own suspicions the meeting may actually be a trap.~
@2079 = ~Regardless, if you hurry, you should be able to make it before their battalion arrives. Don't hesitate to kill Nagate, or any Shadow Thief who dare cross our path.~
@2080 = ~You have your orders now get to it!~
@2081 = ~Finally, you've returned. What is your report?~
@2082 = ~I arrived just in time to witness Nagate's assassination at the hands of Thamuz.~
@2083 = ~What of the Kerykeion?~
@2084 = ~I killed Thamuz and successfully retrieved the second Kerykeion piece. Before our battle, however, we spoke at some length and he had some interesting things to say.~
@2085 = ~I see. Well, go on. If you've something to say, spit it out.~
@2086 = ~He said that someone hired them to exterminate us from Beregost, but would not say who.~
@2087 = ~He said that no mortal is capable of wielding the Kerykeion and if you try you will become a danger to us all.~
@2088 = ~Baldwin, what exactly is your plan after obtaining the Kerykeion?~
@2089 = ~He mentioned they have been aware of all our activities since you founded the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2090 = ~Hmm... that is an interesting choice of words. I will send my spies to investigate this claim. Was there anything else?~
@2091 = ~That is all. I am ready for my next mission.~
@2092 = ~I did warn of you Thamuz' deception. It sounds a poor attempt at sowing distrust between us, incase he failed at killing you.~
@2093 = ~It is nonsense of course, as I have spent my entire life studying the Kerykeion. No mortal has even had the opportunity to wield it, so that is a baseless claim.~
@2094 = ~He mentioned they have been aware of all our activities since you founced the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2095 = ~Now that we are in open war against the Shadow Thieves, there is no reason to further withhold my plans.~
@2096 = ~I will use the Kerykeion to satisfy my vengeance against the Shadow Thieves. I will eliminate their leaders and appropriate their entire organization.~
@2097 = ~I've always suspected as much. I assumed it was them who beat us to the witch in the Gibberling Mountains, as well as those I saw snooping around town before their attack.~
@2098 = ~What exactly is your plan after obtaining the Kerykeion?~
@2099 = ~I will inform you when my spies turn up anything new. In the meantime, ask around the guild for more work.~
@2100 = ~I have found the last piece of the Kerykeion.~
@2101 = ~You, what? How is that possible! Speak, quickly!~
@2102 = ~I found it among the remains of some Shadow Thieves I killed on my last mission.~
@2103 = ~It was hidden in a chest that I picked at the Nashkel carnival.~
@2104 = ~I relieved it from the corpse of a powerful mage, who had the misfortune of crossing me.~
@2105 = ~I purchased it from a smuggler near Baldur's Gate.~
@2106 = ~Is that so? Give it here, so that I may examine it further.~
@2107 = ~*laughing* It is almost unbelievable, is it not? That fate would bring you here, into my den, and stay my hand from killing you.~
@2108 = ~There is still much work to be done, however. Leave me now, while I make the necessary preparations for its assembly.~
@2109 = ~I ran into one of your Snake Heads. He ended up succumbing to his injuries after engaging with the Shadow Thieves. He found this document among their belongings.~
@2110 = ~Give it here, quickly!~
@2111 = ~That foolish bastard. *laughing* Oh, he is a dead man indeed.~
@2112 = ~<CHARNAME>, all of our work is finally about to pay off. It was our own, Gerard Travenhurst, who was responsible for enlisting the services of the Shadow Thieves.~
@2113 = ~Not only that, but the reward he is offering for my execution is none other than the final piece of the Kerykeion!~
@2114 = ~Gerard has had the last piece this whole time?~
@2115 = ~What if we are being led into a trap?~
@2116 = ~How do you wish to proceed?~
@2117 = ~It appears that way, yes. He and the good people of Beregost have been in regular contact with the Shadow Thieves, spying on us and distributing their knowledge of our activities.~
@2118 = ~It is possible, but it will be worth the risk. If I am able to procure the final piece of the Kerykeion and successfully reassemble it, then no trap will be able to ensnare us.~
@2119 = ~Gerard has had the piece this whole time?~
@2120 = ~Meet me at Gerard's, presently! We will end this at his manor, once and for all.~

//h_borlad.D......@2200 - @2399

@2200 = ~Welcome to my home, friends. What is it I can do for you today?~
@2201 = ~Hello Borland. I am here to make arrangements regarding your new payments to the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2202 = ~I know about your little spice operation, Borland, and I'm shutting you down. I will no longer tolerate your drugs infiltrating this city.~
@2203 = ~Sorry, wrong house. I shall take my leave now.~
@2204 = ~Payments? What is the meaning of this? I have no loan through you.~
@2205 = ~You've been selling black lotus without the consent of the Gorgon's Eye. If you wish to continue, you will need to pay us a cut of your profits.~
@2206 = ~Consent? Why the bloody hell do I need your consent to conduct business in my own home?~
@2207 = ~Maybe I'll go tell the guards of your little operation here and see what they think.~
@2208 = ~You haven't thought this through have you? I have the backing of an entire guild behind me. Do you really wish to make us your enemies?~
@2209 = ~If you are going to be difficult, then I have no choice but to use violence. I shall beat you mercilessly until you concede.~
@2210 = ~Because I demand it! *unsheathe your blade* Do as I say or I'll paint the room red with your blood.~
@2211 = ~Look, Borland, It's not a bad deal. Think of it as a security cost. You'll still make out well and you won't have to worry about any... unforeseen accidents.~
@2212 = ~Go ahead, they won't listen to you. I have too much renown in this city. Plus, a few of them are on my client list.~
@2213 = ~*sigh* That is a fair point. I will comply then, as I have no wish to die over a small loss in profits. The trade will still be lucrative enough.~
@2214 = ~Glad you're a reasonable man Borland. Someone will stop by each month to collect your payments.~
@2215 = ~Sorry, but that won't quite cut it. On top of the monthly payments, I will need you to hand over your remaining black lotus, as well as all your coin.~
@2216 = ~*sigh* Alright, I will comply then. I have no wish to die over a loss in profits. The trade will still be lucrative enough.~
@2217 = ~You know, this used to be a respectable town before you gangsters came and took over.~
@2218 = ~What a bloodthirsty bunch of louts you are! You know, this used to be a respectable town before you gangsters came and took over.~
@2219 = ~Get out of my house you damned thief. I have not forgotten our arrangement.~
@2220 = ~Is that so? And what do you plan to do about it?~
@2221 = ~If you don't comply, then I will be forced to turn you into the authorities.~
@2222 = ~Do you not care about all the lives you are ruining?~
@2223 = ~Then I have no choice but to use violence. I shall beat you mercilessly until you agree to cease your drug peddling.~
@2224 = ~Why should I? I don't force my product on anyone. It is 100% their choice. Although, to be fair, the trade is so lucrative I probably wouldn't care anyways.~
@2225 = ~Damn you barbarians! Take the lotus then! Just know that you are making a big mistake messing with one such as me.~
@2226 = ~I'd watch your back around here if I was you.~

@3200 = ~Can't a man enjoy some privacy in his own room? Unless you're the waiter then please, begone.~
@3201 = ~Sorry Carth, but I hope you've had a good last meal. There is a bounty on your head and I'm here to collect it.~
@3202 = ~You must be Carth. I am here regarding your debt with the Zhentarim.~
@3203 = ~Oh, Gods! Please, wait!~
@3204 = ~I was going to pay them back, I was! It's just... right before I was to leave, I was beset by the smells of the most delectable lamb and garlic mash drifting up from the kitchens.~
@3205 = ~The beautiful aroma was enough to drive a man mad I tell you! No rational mind could allow their body to pass on such a pleasure.~

@5614 = ~Get out of my sight you dog! Rigaldo will get his payments.~
@5615 = ~A peaceful solution that ends with robbery? Bah! I've never heard of such absurdity. Leave at once or I'll have my guards escort you by force.~
@5616 = ~Is there any way I could pay or trade you for it, or perhaps do something for you in return?~
@5617 = ~I don't want to hurt you Gerard, but you'll soon leave me no choice.~
@5618 = ~Do you think your guards stand any chance against me? If you don't hand over that necklace now, then I'll be forced to slaughter you all!~
@5619 = ~Absolutely not! I knew Rigaldo's dogs were brainless mutts, but you can't even comprehend the simplest of commands can you? Guards, get this fool out of my sight!~
@5620 = ~By jove! Alright, you can have the necklace, just leave me be!~

@5815 = ~Shit, you're right. This is fake! What kind of fool would think it wise to pull one over on us? Surely, they'd know the consequences would be death.~
@5816 = ~I'm sorry, sir. I don't know how it could have evaded my notice. I will assume full responsibility and accept any punishment you deem fit for my error.~
@5817 = ~Noted. Yet, you are not fully to blame. The craftsmanship is rather brilliant. Whoever constructed these is certainly not without skill.~

@6808 = ~You're an evil wretch you know that? Take the damned rings then and off to the nine hells with you!~
@6809 = ~Please, whoever you are, I need this sale. I must buy passage for my son and I'm nowhere near the amount of coin I need. The buyer is already on his way!~
@6810 = ~And I don't rightly care! I won't inform your husband of your deeds but if you dont give them to me then I'll bury your face in the dirt!~
@6811 = ~I will not pay you for them. But perhaps I can find a way to help your son.~
@6812 = ~If you can guarantee his safe passage then I suppose I could trade you the rings. I have a sister in Athkatla, who is willing to take him in until I can afford my expense as well. I guess I have no choice but to trust you. Here are the rings then.~
@6813 = ~Oh, err... Yes of course, I wasn't expecting you so soon. You look a little more brutish than was described.~
@6814 = ~I am just weary from my travels, m'lady, please forgive my appearance.~

@6817 = ~Oh, yes well with all the bandits on the road, it does add a bit of roughness to you as you travel.~
@6818 = ~Bah, enough of this! I am here to sieze your rings. Hand them over nice-like and I won't have to bury your face in the dirt.~
@6819 = ~Haw haw! It's been a few years since I've heard that one. My daddy was a fisherman you know.~
@6820 = ~Well you do seem like a fine catch if I've ever seen one.~
@6821 = ~Was he now? I've always enjoyed the sport myself. Shall we get to business then?~
@6822 = ~Oh my, *blushes* well, thank you...~
@6823 = ~Hmm, I'd like to ask you a question, if I may. What did one snowman say to the other snowman?~

@6827 = ~We are stuck in a bloody snowglobe!~
@6828 = ~Freeze!~
@6829 = ~Smells like carrots.~
@6830 = ~What kind of question is that?~
@6831 = ~I think you are not who you say you are, and I won't be dealing with the likes of you any longer.~
@6832 = ~Alright, well maybe I'll go find your husband then and inform him of what is going on.~
@6833 = ~*laughs* That's right! I was worried for a moment that you weren't the one I was supposed to meet. Here are your rings then.~
@6834 = ~You know, I was worried for a moment that you weren't the one I was supposed to meet, but now I have no doubts. Here are your rings.~
@6835 = ~Actually, may I ask a favor of you? I'm looking to discretely obtain passage to Athkatla for my son and I. If you know of anyone who could provide such a service, I would be eternally grateful.~
@6836 = ~Sure, I will ask around and look into it for you.~
@6837 = ~Sorry but I don't really have the time for that right now.~
@6838 = ~Oh, thank you! I'll still be here in the meantime, wandering about the farm.~
@6839 = ~Oh, ok sorry. I didn't mean to trouble you. Take care.~
@6840 = ~You came back. Have you found a way out for my son?~
@6841 = ~I'm sorry but I haven't heard of anything just yet.~
@6842 = ~I have something lined up for you in Beregost. Flee tonight with your son and you will be contacted when you are sighted within the city.~
@6843 = ~Thank you, truly. Here, I want you to have something. I found it buried here over a month ago and never was able to sell it. Maybe you can find a use for it. Farewell.~
@6844 = ~Listen here you dungy peasant! I know about the rings and I'm here to sieze them, so give them up right quick and I won't have to bury your body in the hole which you found them!~

@7005 = ~Sorry lady, but I was hired to remove you from the area. I'd advise you to leave peacefully, otherwise I will resort to violence.~
@7006 = ~You would help these men destroy this forest for a few coin? Are all you outsiders guided by nothing but greed? It's sickening! *sigh* Fine, I will play your little game.~
@7007 = ~If you would assist me instead, I can offer you an old and magical weapon amulet. Surely it is worth more than what those beasts have offered.~
@7008 = ~I was sent here to do a job and I mean to finish it. This is your final warning.~
@7009 = ~You've got a deal. Where can I find these men?~
@7010 = ~You monsters are all the same! I am not afraid to protect these lands with my life! Be warned, I am not without skill.~
@7011 = ~They have a small camp set up just to the south of here. Their leader is a dangerous man by the name of Asnabel. He is not to be trusted!~
@7012 = ~I can still sense their presence in these woods. Why have you returned?~
@7013 = ~I've decided to just kill you and collect the bounty.~
@7014 = ~Where is the campsite again?~
@7015 = ~Head directly south from here and you should run right into it.~
@7016 = ~I am relieved to see you. The trees whispered to me that blood had been spilled and I feared the worst.~

@7204 = ~By "private contracts", do you really mean assassin-for-hire?~
@7205 = ~Who is Riggy?~
@7206 = ~Pleasure to meet you Liedel. What current bounties do you have available?~
@7207 = ~*laughing* That's my nickname for little ol' Rigaldo. Oh, I do love how much he detests that name.~
@7208 = ~What current bounties do you have available?~
@7209 = ~Does that bother you? To be fair, most people do shy away from the job at first, until learning how lucrative the trade can be.~
@7210 = ~What current bounties do you have available.~
@7211 = ~I'm not interested in any bounty hunting right now.~
@7212 = ~Suit yourself.~
@7213 = ~Well, look who decided to come back. *laughing* Changed your tune, have you? Or did you just come by for a chat?~
@7214 = ~I'll be going now.~
@7215 = ~As of right now, I have three unclaimed bounties.~
@7216 = ~The first one is for a man named Carth. He borrowed money from the Zhentarim and failed to pay them back on time. They request his debt to be settled with either coin, or his life.~
@7217 = ~He was last seen heading north, past the Coast Way. He is a rather large man who wouldn't last a day in the wilderness, so I would search for him in a surrounding inn or tavern.~
@7218 = ~The second contract is for a rogue by the name of Vapula Simberg. He was once a member of the thieves guild in Baldur's Gate, but after years of depravity he couldn't stomach the work anymore.~
@7219 = ~He testified against his guildmates, placing several of them in prison and forcing them to pay substantial fines and bribes.~
@7220 = ~Our latest reports suggest he has turned to the cloth, living a new life of piety. I would suggest you start looking for him wandering about the temples.~
@7221 = ~The third bounty is for a courtesan here in Beregost, named Aisha. I'm absent all the details but it seems to be over a lovers quarrel or some such.~
@7222 = ~She has no known family and doesn't have the means to get far on her own. She is most likely hiding out somewhere in the city.~
@7223 = ~That is all I have for now. Return to me when you have made any progress.~
@7224 = ~Back already, darling? Do you have any news for me?~
@7225 = ~I am here regarding the bounty on Carth.~
@7226 = ~I am here regarding the bounty on Vapula.~
@7227 = ~I am here regarding the bounty on Aisha.~
@7228 = ~Nothing to report as of yet.~
@7229 = ~Alright, I'm listening.~
@7230 = ~I killed him after I found him hiding out at the Friendly Arm Inn.~
@7231 = ~Good work, <CHARNAME>. Here is you reward then, 500 gold coins.~
@7232 = ~That bounty was recently pulled, it seems he was able to repay his debt.~
@7233 = ~I killed him after I found him training at the Temple of Lathander. I have his pendant here as proof.~
@7234 = ~Indeed you do, and it appears to be authentic.~
@7235 = ~I killed her after finding her in a room at the Red Sheaf.~
@7236 = ~That bounty is no longer available.~
@7237 = ~*yawn* Things are a bit slow at the moment. Not that I'm surprised, though. What more could you expect from a boring little town like this?~
@7238 = ~I have some new bounties available if you are interested in hearing them.~
@7239 = ~Yes, I'm interested.~
@7240 = ~The first bounty I have is for a runaway slave named Europea. She escaped from her owner's house here in Beregost and fled into the western woods.~
@7241 = ~If she is brought in alive, he is offering twice the usual reward. Otherwise, he requests the return of her slave-collar as proof she is dead.~
@7242 = ~The next bounty is for a dryad named Katreda. A couple of hunters wish to log a section of the Larswood and build a hunting compound.~
@7243 = ~Katreda is making it all but impossible for them to begin their work and they wish for her to be removed, peacefully... or permanently.~
@7244 = ~The last bounty is a bit of a strange one, even for me. A necromancer named Zhontac, is looking for someone who is willing to bring him a human corpse to practice his magic on.~
@7245 = ~Coincidentally, one of his previous victims had escaped and put a bounty out on Zhontac himself.~
@7246 = ~You can either help Zhontac with his quest, or kill him and collect his bounty. The most profitable play of course would be to do both. Help Zhontac first and then kill him after recieving your reward.~
@7247 = ~Either way, he can be found in his backyard on the eastern side of town, practicing his magic after sundown.~
@7248 = ~I am here regarding the bounty on Europea.~
@7249 = ~I am here regarding the bounty on Katreda.~
@7250 = ~I am here regarding the bounty on Zhontac.~
@7251 = ~I have her with me here. She is a bit roughed up but is still alive.~
@7252 = ~Poor girl. I'll inform her owner. Here is your reward, 1,000 gold coins for returning her alive.~
@7253 = ~I found her dead in the woods and have her slave collar here with me.~
@7254 = ~I will inform her owner. Here is your usual reward, 500 gold coins.~
@7255 = ~She refused to leave the hunters alone so I was forced to kill her.~
@7256 = ~Dryads are a stubborn bunch. Here is your usual reward, 500 gold coins.~
@7257 = ~I completed his request and decided to let him live to finish his research.~
@7258 = ~I'm surprised you didn't go for the extra bounty. Here is you reward then, 500 gold coins.~
@7259 = ~I completed his request and then killed him for his bounty.~
@7260 = ~Excellent work. I'm sure the payoff will be well worth the efforts.~
@7261 = ~I decided to collect his bounty without entertaining his request.~
@7262 = ~Honestly, I don't blame you. It was a little out there. Here is your usual reward then, 500 gold coins.~
@7263 = ~Gods, I get so bored around here, I don't know how much more of it I can take. Even Riggy's been all business lately so he's no help.~
@7264 = ~What is it? Am I expected to bow in the presence of the new guildmaster?~
@7265 = ~Oh, my. That was exhilarating! Poor Riggy, though. It was clear he'd be overmatched, but that foolish pride of his...~
@7266 = ~At any rate, I've decided that I will enlist in the Shadow Thieves. These small-time guilds just don't do it for me anymore. Maybe I'll see you around one day, <CHARNAME>.~

@7402 = ~Yes, of course! I did not expect you so soon. I am willing to pay 600 gold pieces per pound, if the quality is of high standard, that is.~
@7403 = ~How much black lotus have you managed to bring me?~
@7404 = ~I have brought all five pounds and as you can see it is of the finest quality.~
@7405 = ~I ran into a little trouble on the road, but I was still able to bring in four pounds. As you can see, it is of the finest quality.~
@7406 = ~Indeed it is. Here is your payment then, friend. Would you care to join us for a round? It will only take but a moment to prepare the petals.~
@7407 = ~Perhaps another time, I must be going now.~
@7408 = ~Sure, why not? I'll give it a try.~

@7602 = ~Quite a magnificent pool isn't it? The swirling of the water is absolutely mesmerizing. (Snap his neck.)~
@7603 = ~Sorry to interrupt your soul-searching, but there is a necromancer in the city who wishes you dead.~
@7604 = ~Really? What could I have possible done to offend this person? I spend near all my time in solitude, and I have no quarrels or debts with anyone.~
@7605 = ~He wants to use your corpse for his ressurection experiments. He believes your blue hair will have some sort of benefit to his reseach.~
@7606 = ~I don't remember. I don't really want to get involved honestly, I just figured I'd let you know.~
@7607 = ~Interesting. What is it he is trying to learn from me?~
@7608 = ~He believes he can figure out a way to make ressurection easier and more affordable for the common folk.~
@7609 = ~I see. Well if that is the case, then I have no objection. I've lived a great life and this has been a wonderful day.~
@7610 = ~Wait, what? You can't be serious.~
@7611 = ~I'm not going to kill you, I came here to warn you!~
@7612 = ~My mother was killed many years ago and the healers of my village refused to revive her. I have never been able to accept their decision and have resented them ever since.~
@7613 = ~If my death allows others to avoid this suffering then I will gladly give my life in the name of progress.~

@7808 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Please hurry, I am beginning to fear for her safety.~
@7809 = ~Have you brought any news of Ilena?~
@7810 = ~Nothing new, yet.~
@7811 = ~Isley attacked his wife and left her dying on the floor. I found this piece of cloth and a helmet inside the house.~
@7812 = ~I'm sorry, Meredia. I was able to kill Isley for what he did, but not before he took Ilena's life.~
@7813 = ~That is the same color of Ilena's dress!~
@7814 = ~But this fabric isn't right. This style of threading is more common among military uniforms! The helmet you found would substantiate that as well.~
@7815 = ~This is not good. My only hope is that Ilena is safe and still alive. Isley probably fled like a coward after attacking his wife and he must have taken Ilena with him!~
@7816 = ~If you can figure out what style of uniform this is then maybe you'll be able to find them!~
@7817 = ~Ilena has returned safe and sound. You are an honorable <MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>.~
@7818 = ~We have all pooled our gold together and wish you to have it as a reward.~
@7819 = ~Thank you for everything you have done, truly.~
@7820 = ~Ilena... I'm sorry.~
@7821 = ~Thank you for doing what you could, <CHARNAME>.~
@7822 = ~Welcome yourselves to the Gorgon's Den, where we offer a diverse and highly skilled staff ready to attend your every desire.~
@7823 = ~Our current rates are 40 gold for the hour. Guild members will pay half. Would you be interested in our services?~
@7824 = ~No, not at this time.~
@7825 = ~Yes, I think I would be.~
@7826 = ~I'm looking into a man named Xevec, who may have used counterfeit gold at Gilbald's casino. Can you tell me anything more about him?~
@7827 = ~Suit yourself. We'll be here when the urge strikes.~
@7828 = ~Very good. Right this way then and I will introduce you to the available whores this evening.~
@7829 = ~I hope everything was to your satisfication. See us again soon, will you?~
@7830 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. Congratulations on becoming the new guildmaster. If you wish, you may use our services free of charge, of course.~
@7831 = ~Yes, I would like that.~
@7832 = ~Not at this time.~
@7833 = ~Yes, I know Xevec well. In fact, he spent quite some time with us just last night. What would you like to know?~
@7834 = ~Did he say or do anything that was unusual last night?~
@7835 = ~Can you tell me anything more specific about him?~
@7836 = ~Can you check to see if this gold coin matches up with any of the ones he used here?~
@7837 = ~Do you know where I could find him?~
@7838 = ~He wouldn't stop talking about a new job he was getting, that according to him, "Would set him up for life.".~
@7839 = ~Whoever hired Xevec paid him a hefty sum up front. He decided to spend it here to celebrate his success.~
@7840 = ~Thanks, Meredia. You have been a great help.~
@7841 = ~Well, he's not the brightest man, to be sure. He's violent, crass, and always on the lookout for the next get-rich-quick scheme. Obviously, it's never worked out for him.~
@7842 = ~It will be tedious, as we don't seperate payments, but I can check through last nights count. Wait here a moment.~
@7843 = ~...~
@7844 = ~By Sune! They're all fake! Hundreds of them! How did I not notice? It has to be from Xevec, no one else spent as much as him last night!~
@7845 = ~He lives somewhere on the streets of Beregost, but I don't know where exactly.~
@7846 = ~I have seen him in the north-end on occasion. You might want to first check there.~
@7847 = ~Not a problem, <CHARNAME>. It's always a pleasure seeing you.~

//h_nagatd.d......@8000 - @8199

@8000 = ~Are you lost, friend? You seem a bit out of place considering the areas locale.~
@8001 = ~I am not lost, thank you. You must be Nagate? I am here regarding the Kerykeion piece you have for sale.~
@8002 = ~You can tell your men to come out from the shadows, Nagate. Hand over the Kerykeion and I will spare your lives.~
@8003 = ~I haven't the time for these games. Draw your daggers and let's end this farce!~
@8004 = ~Ah, yes of course. You must be with the Shadow Thieves, then? I am Nagate, and I am indeed selling what you seek.~
@8005 = ~If I may ask, where did you acquire such a find?~
@8006 = ~It was given to me by a Calimshite as repayment for his debt. I ended up having the man killed, as I presumed it was nothing more than broken scrap.~
@8007 = ~Luckily, I did some research and uncovered its true worth. Well, lucky for me that is.~
@8008 = ~I wasn't told the price, how much is it you are asking?~
@8009 = ~40,000 gold pieces. I don't haggle and I won't go any lower. It is a fair price for all things considered.~
@8010 = ~Might I examine it first to ensure its authenticity?~
@8011 = ~Certainly, if you wouldn't mind showing me your coin first. I don't have time for window-shoppers.~
@8012 = ~I don't have that much gold on me at present.~
@8013 = ~I have the gold right here. Now, may I please see the staff?~
@8014 = ~Then I guess we'll have to make do with whatever else you've got.~
@8015 = ~Of course. I have it right here...~
@8016 = ~What a disturbing lack of manners you have. So be it. I'll be delighted to relieve your corpse of its coin and weapons.~
@8017 = ~*sharp whistle* Come out you men! And let's get to the killing!~
@8018 = ~Men?...~
@8019 = ~Oh, bloody hell.~

//h_nobled.d......@8200 - @8399

@8200 = ~I suppose you mean *Samantha*, in which case yes, that is what she is called.~
@8201 = ~Why that is of concern to you, however, is worrisome enough for me to notify the guards.~
@8202 = ~I think she might be in danger. Someone is trying to have her killed.~
@8203 = ~Cut the attitude lady, I'm trying to save your daughter from being assassinated. Tell me everything you know so I can be on my way.~
@8204 = ~Do you know if she has any enemies or someone who would want to hurt her?~
@8205 = ~Eh? Samantha is a good girl who would give no cause for such things. Sounds like nonsense to me.~
@8206 = ~Are you sure about that? I talked with the maid and she doesn't seem to care for her at all.~
@8207 = ~That is of no surprise. Samantha and I both detest the wretch, and with good reason. Not a ten-day ago, she was caught with Samantha's missing necklace stuffed into her pockets.~
@8208 = ~I would have her sent off to the dungeons myself, yet she is a relative of my husband and he would not allow it.~
@8209 = ~I dare to imagine what else she may have stolen from my house.~
@8210 = ~Does this coin look familiar to you?~
@8211 = ~It does not. In fact, its grotesque forgery makes me feel unwell. Remove it from my sight at once.~
@8212 = ~Is your daughter's name Sam, by any chance?~
@8213 = ~I'll be going now.~

//h_quassd.d......@8400 - @8599

@8400 = ~Easy there there, <CHARNAME>. Hands at your side and refrain from any sudden movements. Refuse and your life will be forfeit.~
@8401 = ~Good luck with that. Do you know how many of your kin I have killed already?~
@8402 = ~If you wanted us dead you would have done it already. What is it you have to say?~
@8403 = ~That won't be happening. Draw steel you cowards!~
@8404 = ~If we brought the full might of the Shadow Thieves down upon you then your feeble guild would stand no chance against us.~
@8405 = ~However, I did not come here pursuing confrontation.~
@8406 = ~Very perceptive, and straight to the point. I will respect that by doing the same.~
@8407 = ~I seek to parley and discuss a proposition that I believe to be mutually beneficial.~
@8408 = ~Alright, I'm listening.~
@8409 = ~Don't waste your breath. I wouldn't trust anything you had to say.~
@8410 = ~The threat your guildmaster wishes to bring into this world must be extinguished at all costs.~
@8411 = ~He cannot be allowed to collect the final piece of the Kerykeion and I would have you ensure us of that.~
@8412 = ~What's in it for me?~
@8413 = ~Not a chance. I'm not going to betray my guildmaster.~
@8414 = ~Aside from preventing a catastrophic amount of destruction, you mean? Bah! Alongside sparing your life, if you cooperate with us then you will recieve quite a substantial reward.~
@8415 = ~Sorry, but that's not good enough.~
@8416 = ~Alright, you've got a deal. I will betray the Gorgon's Eye. What do you need me to do?~
@8417 = ~We have created a fake Kerykeion piece that you will bring back to Baldwin. If he tries to fuse it together with any real piece, then the process will fail and result in his death.~
@8418 = ~We have a spy on the inside who will contact you when necessary. Their identity will be revealed by their use of the code word, "The shortbow of the Shaar.".~
@8419 = ~By order of the Shadow Thieves, I officially decree you as part of our auxiliary forces. You are hereby required to carry out your duty, under penalty of death. Good day.~
@8420 = ~A pity. Then we will end this with bloodshed.~

//h_rich2d.d......@8600 - @8799

@8600 = ~What is this abomination? The plan was a failure! Men, to arms!~
@8601 = ~<CHARNAME>! We must defeat Baldwin before he is allowed to escape! My rogues will assist you with the rest of the guild!~
@8602 = ~The Kerykeion's power must have been stronger than we anticipated to allow him to transform into that... monstrosity.~
@8603 = ~Regardless, Baldwin now lays dead and the Kerykeion has disintegrated beyond repair.~
@8604 = ~The real piece, however, has been secretly held in my possession for many years.~
@8605 = ~My brother has soiled any significance it once held. I will offer it to you as a reward for your aid and to put our history behind us.~
@8606 = ~With that, I shall take my leave. Rhade will stay behind and clean up whats left of the operations here. Good day.~
@8607 = ~Baldwin, this has gone on long enough! Take hold of your senses and cease this folly at once!~
@8608 = ~Hello, brother. You've come just in time to witness my ascension into godhood.~
@8609 = ~The Kerykeion has driven you to madness it seems. Surrender it to me and I will bring you in before the Shadowmaster. If you cooperate, your life shall be spared.~
@8610 = ~Do you take me a for a fool, brother? After all these years, the Kerykeion is finally within my grasp. Yet, you offer me your dungeons, while I could have the world instead!~
@8611 = ~It was a dream we both shared once, do you remember? Or did you forget that too, along with your honor, after betraying your own brother!~
@8612 = ~I have not forgotten, yet I can't say the same for you. I spoke words of warning against the Kerykeion, not desire for its ressurection!~
@8613 = ~You were the one who betrayed us. It appears your mania has distorted your memories and led you down a path of delusion.~
@8614 = ~You are lost, Baldwin, and you have been for many years.~
@8615 = ~I see you are as cowardly as you were on the day of my banishment. You are still restrained by your fear and lack of ambition, and that is why you will fail.~
@8616 = ~Everyone, prepare yourselves for battle! <CHARNAME>, protect me while I finish making the final adjustments to the Kerykeion!~
@8617 = ~...~
@8618 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@8619 = ~Baldwin, your guild betrays you. <CHARNAME>, Rhade, they have seen through your delusions and now fight alongside us.~
@8620 = ~As for the others, I give you this chance to join with me and strike down your master! Can't you see is only using you for his own agenda!~
@8621 = ~<CHARNAME>, it's not true is it? How could you do this your own guild!~
@8622 = ~I knew I smelled somethin' funny on you when you first walked in here!~
@8623 = ~If it weren't for Baldwin, I'd still be out on the streets. I'll die before I let this guild fall into the hands of you lot!~
@8624 = ~What have you done, you traitorous bastards! Are you truly fool enough to bring the Shadow Thieves into our own den!~
@8625 = ~No matter, *unsheathes blade* even alone I could slice through the lot of you like butter!~
@8626 = ~*laughing* Finally, some action around here! Sorry, Baldwin, but I think it's time for me to switch things up a bit.~
@8627 = ~Consider this my official resignation from the Gorgon's Eye.~
@8628 = ~I knew you were hiding something from us, <CHARNAME>, but, Eury, I never saw that coming.~
@8629 = ~Heh. I'll take that as a compliment.~
@8630 = ~Shall we get to it then?~
@8631 = ~It matters not how many of you turn coat against me. Your fruitless exchange has allowed me enough time to complete my preparations! Now, you will all suffer for the injustices you have wrought against me!~
@8632 = ~AHHHHH!!!~

//h_richad.d......@8800 - @8999

@8800 = ~<CHARNAME>! Set aside your quarrel with us. We must kill this abomination before it is too late!~
@8801 = ~Come on you men! Attack!~
@8802 = ~Our objectives are complete and we have no further dispute among us. The piece Gerard held was a fake, with the purpose of tricking Baldwin.~
@8803 = ~Using it in conjuction with a real piece should have killed him instantly. He took the bait but experienced a different reaction than we had planned.~
@8804 = ~Regardless, Baldwin now lays dead and the Kerykeion has disintegrated beyond repair.~
@8805 = ~The real piece, however, has been secretly held in my possession for many years.~
@8806 = ~My brother has soiled any significance it once held. I will offer it to you as a reward for your aid and as a gesture to put our history behind us.~
@8807 = ~<CHARNAME>, your abilities have not gone unnoticed to our organization. Perhaps it would be beneficial for us to continue collaborating in some fashion. Expect an envoy in the near future to discuss terms.~
@8808 = ~Baldwin, enough! Take hold of your senses and cease this folly at once!~
@8809 = ~Hello, brother. Come to see my ascension into godhood, have you? How very gracious of you.~
@8810 = ~The Kerykeion has driven you to madness it seems. Surrender it to me and I will bring you in before the Shadowmaster. If you cooperate, your life shall be spared.~
@8811 = ~Do you take me a for a fool, brother? After all these years, the Kerykeion is finally within my grasp. Yet, you offer me your dungeons, while I could have the world instead!~

//h_rigald.d......@9000 - @9199

@9000 = ~Mind yourself now, or see you'll leave with less than you came.~
@9001 = ~You must be one of Baldwin's new recuits then, aye? My name's Rigaldo and I'm the head pickpocket around here. I'll be your superior officer and I expect you to address me as such.~
@9002 = ~You will be reporting to me for all of your guild assignments as they become available. My expectations are high and I trust all my rogues to deliver. Do you have any questions before we begin?~
@9003 = ~Why do you and Baldwin look like Shadow Thieves?~
@9004 = ~What if I am tasked with doing something that I do not agree with?~
@9005 = ~None, I eagerly await my first mission.~
@9006 = ~And how would you know what a Shadow Thief looks like, eh?~
@9007 = ~Only from books and tales of their exploits. I grew up studying in Candlekeep.~
@9008 = ~I doubt any book would have reliable words on such a secretive organization, but I can't deny your perception. Indeed, Baldwin and I were once members of the Shadow Thieves, but we no longer share that affiliation.~
@9009 = ~I am ready to recieve my first mission.~
@9010 = ~Any unwillingness to follow orders will result in the immediate conclusion of your enlistment.~
@9011 = ~Excellent. I will be sending you on a trial run of sorts so that I can properly gauge your abilities.~
@9012 = ~I can handle any test of yours. What is it you would have me do?~
@9013 = ~On second thought, I don't really have time for this right now.~
@9014 = ~There is a dealer of gems and other various trinkets who is currently vacating a room at Feldepost's Inn. He is on his way to the Nashkel Carnival to present his wares, so he won't be staying here for much longer.~
@9015 = ~Our intel suggests he likes to keep his most prized item on his person at all times. Your task is to go and relieve him of whatever that may be.~
@9016 = ~Sounds simple enough. Is there anything else that I should know?~
@9017 = ~He enjoys his privacy above all else and won't have his guards accompanying him during his stay. This should be an easy in-and-out for any thief.~
@9018 = ~It won't be long before he leaves for the carnival, so best not to delay your efforts.~
@9019 = ~Welcome back my little friends. How did you fair on your first deed?~
@9020 = ~Well enough I'd say for such an easy task. I was able to procure this quite expensive looking diamond.~
@9021 = ~I have a few other things I need to do first.~
@9022 = ~Yes, well, better to acquaint your feet to the water before diving in. Congratulations on completing your first mission! There's no better thrill than the rush of cutting a purse now is there?~
@9023 = ~You have proven to possess the skills necessary to succeed on your own merits, and without these instincts, a thief is nothing.~
@9024 = ~However, we do have certain tools we can use to enhance our capabilities. We don't depend on them, but instead use them to compliment our existing skills.~
@9025 = ~With that being said, I shall reward you with this ring. It is from a series that I have crafted myself. When used properly, it can sharpen your sleight of hand and make easy work of your marks while out in the field.~
@9026 = ~If you are ready to begin, I have another assignment for you.~
@9027 = ~I am ready for my next mission.~
@9028 = ~I am sure you're aware of the large manor here in northern Beregost, yes? Well its proprietor, Gerard Travenhurst, pays us to ensure that his house remains safe and... unburgled.~
@9029 = ~However, in a rather rash act of rebellion, Mr. Travenhurst has not only failed to pay us but has hired extra security at his premises.~
@9030 = ~I would have you go down and straighten this man out. Demand he hand over his family pendant and resume his usual payments. Only then will we forgive his discourtesy.~
@9031 = ~Why just his pendant, is it that expensive of a piece?~
@9032 = ~I dislike the task, but I understand you have a reputation to maintain.~
@9033 = ~What should I do if he refuses to hand it over?~
@9034 = ~Good as done. I'll return when I have the pendant in my possession.~
@9035 = ~The pendant's worth is measured in sentiment, as opposed to coin. This is his most prized family heirloom and is an obvious way to get our message across.~
@9036 = ~I'll return when I have the pendant in my possession.~
@9037 = ~*We* have a reputation to maintain. Or did you forget you are among our ranks? Off with you now, and don't return empty-handed.~
@9038 = ~For a helpless noble, he does have quite the spirit. If he doesn't respond to threats, then violence may be the only answer.~
@9039 = ~Well? What did good ol' Gerard have to say for himself? Were you able to acquire his pendant?~
@9040 = ~Here it is. Gerard will be resuming his payments and his guards will no longer be an issue.~
@9041 = ~I must admit, upon first glance I didn't take you for the ruffian sort, but you've certainly demonstrated otherwise. Here is your payment for the task.~
@9042 = ~Congratulations, <CHARNAME>. Your trial phase has concluded and you have been promoted to a full-fledged member of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@9043 = ~You may now speak with Liedel for a current list of all our active bounties. Other guild members may have odd jobs for you to pick up as well.~
@9044 = ~Also, before you depart, Baldwin wishes a word with you. I wouldn't keep him waiting.~
@9045 = ~Baldwin wishes a word with you. Finish your business with him and then return to me for your next assignment.~
@9046 = ~Ah, my friends! Back for another venture in the pursuit of coin, are we? Well, a strange report from Nashkel just reached my ear and I'll be sending you down to investigate.~
@9047 = ~A lass by the name of Karp, has mysteriously found several magical items buried on her farmland this past season.~
@9048 = ~Her latest find was a pair of rings that are to be sold to a man from Ulgoth's Beard, who is traveling down now as we speak.~
@9049 = ~Our intelligence has reported back two things of note. First, she has been auctioning these items off through fences and smugglers, instead of selling them to storefronts on the up and up.~
@9050 = ~Second, and giving probable cause for her secretive deals, she is withholding all of her findings from her husband, the poor sod.~
@9051 = ~I will have you travel south and obtain these rings in a manner that is fitting to your judgement.~
@9052 = ~You could extort the woman with threat of reveal to her husband, or you could put on a ruse, feigning as the man from Ulgoth's Beard. You could also just intimidate her into giving them up, if you've the brawn for it.~
@9053 = ~If you wish to skip all the drudgery, then you could simply pick the rings off her as well.~
@9054 = ~I'm not against using blackmail. If she's willing to engage in shady dealings behind her husband's back, then she may not be so innocent herself.~
@9055 = ~Acting as the buyer sounds like good fun and a chance for me to use my charm and charisma.~
@9056 = ~I think I'll just practice my thieving skills and steal the rings off her when she's not looking.~
@9057 = ~I'm not sure what I will do yet until I speak with this Karp first.~
@9058 = ~Yes, well, if you manage to procure both of theses rings before their eventual sale, then I will allow you to keep one as compensation for your efforts.~
@9059 = ~If you're speaking to me then I assume you are ready to make your report and have the requested items in your possession.~
@9060 = ~I do. I was able to procure both of her rings.~
@9061 = ~Excellent! You have certainly earned your reward. As we agreed, you may keep one of them to do with as you wish.~
@9062 = ~We are planning an extensive operation at the Naskel Carnival and I want you in charge of some preparatory work. I will be assigning you several different targets, so prepare yourself accordingly.~
@9063 = ~There are two large tents where all their gambling winnings and licenses are stored. Your targets are the gamesmen inside who will all be armed with stun darts. Your task is to sneak in quietly and disarm them of their weapons.~
@9064 = ~Ariosh and his rogues will be stationed behind the westernmost tent, awaiting your arrival. After you've retrieved the weapons, head to the rendezvous point and distribute the darts among them.~
@9065 = ~We will use their own weapons against them.~
@9066 = ~They will grab the licenses and as much coin as they can carry, while you report back to me for further instruction. If everything goes accordingly, then we'll all be a lot richer by days end.~
@9067 = ~What exactly do we need the gambling licenses for?~
@9068 = ~Isn't that Shadow Thief territoy? What if they find out about what we are doing?~
@9069 = ~Understood. I'll be back shortly.~
@9070 = ~They will be used to expand and legitimize some of our operations in Amn, making their appropriation our prime objective.~
@9071 = ~Isn't that in Shadow Thief territoy? What if they find out about what we are doing?~
@9072 = ~They most certainly will, you can be sure of that. It is unnerving, I'll admit, but these orders come directly from Baldwin.~
@9073 = ~Don't worry yourself too much, though. The Shadow Thieves have surprisingly little stake in the gambling trade and the bulk of their forces tend to remain below the Cloud Peaks.~
@9074 = ~As you can see we are entrusting you with more responsibility in this mission. This will certainly test your skills as a pickpocket and if successful, will increase your standing within the guild.~
@9075 = ~This is a sizable operation and there is no room for error. Relieve every gamesman of their weapons before informing the men. They will take it from there.~
@9076 = ~I am already aware of your deed and the outcome could not have been more favorable. With the gamesmen unarmed, the mission was a complete success.~
@9077 = ~With the licenses in our possession, we can now begin preparations for our expansion further south. Your reward is well earned.~
@9078 = ~No new leads as of yet. Ask around the guild, someone may have some work for you in the meantime.~
@9079 = ~I have a small task lined up that I wish you to perform.~
@9080 = ~There is a bit of a local legend around here who goes by the name, Borland of Beregost. He's known for opening his door to travelers seeking shelter and offering them a free place to rest.~
@9081 = ~However, he is not as innocent as he may seem. He is using his home and hospitality as a front to sell black lotus and other spices to his guests.~
@9082 = ~Your task is a simple one. If Borland wishes to continue his dealings then he has to pay us a cut of his profits.~
@9083 = ~If he refuses... well then take him for all he has got. Clear out his inventory of spice and relieve him of all his current coin.~
@9084 = ~I've stayed at Borland's plenty of times and he's never offered me any spice.~
@9085 = ~Understood. I will get him to pay his dues.~
@9086 = ~Is that so? Well, perhaps you had rasied his suspicion in some way. If you meant to imply that my intel was questionable, however, know that I do not deal with uncertainties.~
@9087 = ~Get to it then. His residence is on the east side of the city, across from the Red Sheaf.~
@9088 = ~Was Mr. Borland agreeable to our offer?~
@9089 = ~Yes, he will be making his payments forthwith.~
@9090 = ~Yes, and he was so enthusiastic about our new arrangement that he gave me all of his black lotus.~
@9091 = ~Unfortunately, he was not. I have procured the rest of his inventory and he will not be selling spice here any longer.~
@9092 = ~I knew I could count on you. Here is your reward for the deed.~
@9093 = ~I knew I could count on you. Here is your reward for the deed and I'll even throw in a little extra for the lotus.~
@9094 = ~Not the most ideal outcome but at least you didn't come back empty handed. Here is your reward for the lotus.~
@9095 = ~I knew going after their casinos was a careless idea. Grab your weapons from Rhade and prepare yourselves. This will be a bloody night.~
@9096 = ~Nice work taking care of those Shadow Thieves. I know first hand how troublesome they can be.~
@9097 = ~I have a new mission for you that will involve smuggling some goods into Amn.~
@9098 = ~I made contact with Borland's spice supplier and we were able to come to terms on a very profitable arrangement.~
@9099 = ~He will be making regular shipments to our warehouses of the finest black lotus petals on the market.~
@9100 = ~I am sending you to the Nashkel Carnival to deliver the first batch to our buyer. He will be awaiting you in the eastern-most tent.~
@9101 = ~Is it safe to go back into Amn while we are at war with the Shadow Thieves?~
@9102 = ~How much coin should I expect to recieve from the buyer?~
@9103 = ~Is there anything else I should know before departing?~
@9104 = ~Absolutely not. But, risk is a requisite of ambition and without it even the most experienced of thieves can become careless and complacent.~
@9105 = ~You will be transporting five pounds of black lotus at 600 gold pieces per pound. I will award you with a 20% cut upon your success.~
@9106 = ~Try to stay off the main roads in case the Flaming Fist have their patrols out.~
@9107 = ~You should also make use of your stealth after entering Amn, lest the Shadow Thieves become aware of your arrival.~
@9108 = ~Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. Were you able to successfully transport all of the black lotus?~
@9109 = ~I was beset by both the Flaming Fist and the Shadow Thieves but I was still able to manage. Here is the coin.~
@9110 = ~I ran into some trouble on the road and was forced to bribe the Flaming Fist with a pound of the lotus.~
@9111 = ~Very impressive work, <CHARNAME>. I'll take the 3000 gold and return your 20%, with an extra 5% for your trouble, totalling 750 gold.~
@9112 = ~Damn those corrupt bastards! Yet, either way, I applaud your quick thinking. At our price point we still made out fairly well. I'll take the 2400 gold and return your 20%, totalling 480 gold.~
@9113 = ~So, you'll be our new leader then? Things were going pretty good until Baldwin's mania took over. Keep a level head and things will go just fine.~

//h_rogued.d......@9200 - @9399

@9200 = ~First time I seen yer face down here.~
@9201 = ~Keep it movin'. I've been snippin' purses here since afore ye was born.~
@9202 = ~Watch yer back in there.~
@9203 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>. How ye be fairing lately?~

//h_saradd.d......@9400 - @9599

@9400 = ~Sorry, but I haven't the time nor desire to speak with you at present.~
@9401 = ~Yes? What is it I can help you with?~
@9402 = ~I'm interested in learning about the Kerykeion, can you tell me anything about it?~
@9403 = ~How did Baldwin become known as "The Butcher"?~
@9404 = ~Nothing at the moment.~
@9405 = ~I can tell you many things. What is it that you wish to know?~
@9406 = ~Why does Baldwin seem so interested in obtaining the Kerykeion?~
@9407 = ~What types of powers does the staff possess?~
@9408 = ~I would like to know more about its history.~
@9409 = ~That is all for now, I must be going.~
@9410 = ~Baldwin had first learned of the staff from his elder brother Richard, who would fill his ears with tales of its past and hopes for its future.~
@9411 = ~Over time his fascination with the staff grew rapidly. He became obsessed, spending all his time buried in research. It eventually led to his banishment from the Shadow Thieves.~
@9412 = ~What exactly did they banish him for?~
@9413 = ~What can you tell me about Baldwin's time in the Shadow Thieves?~
@9414 = ~Can you tell me anything more about his brother, Richard?~
@9415 = ~I'd like to ask you about something else.~
@9416 = ~He would repeatedly defer, ignore, and disobey his orders in favor of his personal investigations. He was eventually turned in by his own brother after an unsuccessful attempt to steal restricted documents from another officer's personal vault.~
@9417 = ~He was a respected rogue with some command in the Shadow Thieves, Athkatla branch in Amn, working directly under his more renown superior, Renal Bloodscalp.~
@9418 = ~I know he was an exceptional rogue in his own right. He was very direct and unwavering in his actions, yet he lacked the ambition and initiative that Baldwin posessed.~
@9419 = ~The Kerykeion was a great staff of power most notably known for its ability to petrify any who met its gaze. It's also documented to be capable of summoning an endless swarm of serpents to assist its wielder.~
@9420 = ~Is there anything else that it can do?~
@9421 = ~There is one scroll that suggests it has the ability to unlock a mage's limitations on spellcasting, allowing spells to have negligible interference with ones aura.~
@9422 = ~The Kerykeion has a very muddled past and is tough to piece together efficiently, due to many contradicting excerpts. There are only a few things of certainty.~
@9423 = ~Originally, it bore a different name, Caduceus, and was created by a demon residing in the Underworld. He eventually fell prey to the two immortal and voracious, snake-like beings known as the Gorgon sisters.~
@9424 = ~However, they also had a mortal half-sister, Medusa, who was jealous of their immortality. She took revenge against them by stealing the staff to use in tandem with her dark magic. She was able to trap their essence within it, creating the Kerykeion and cursing their infinite existence.~
@9425 = ~In what ways did that change the staff?~
@9426 = ~What happened after that?~
@9427 = ~The curse transformed her sisters into petrified serpents that now entwine the staff. It endlessly feeds off their power, growing exceedingly stronger as time goes on.~
@9428 = ~Eons after Medusa's death, the Kerykeion was passed around many lesser gods until arriving here on Toril at the dawn of the Time of Troubles.~
@9429 = ~Accounts of its use and whereabouts differ to a large extent, but all conclude that it was destroyed in some type of large battle. We believe the fragments eventually became scattered around different regions of the Sword Coast.~
@9430 = ~Ah yes, I suppose a name like that does bring out ones curious nature.~
@9431 = ~It is a title he picked up following his departure from the Shadow Thieves, some years ago.~
@9432 = ~They left him with nothing, not a single coin nor weapon. He was lost for a while, living in the slums and eating leftover scraps from the inns.~
@9433 = ~The only thing keeping him going was the thought of revenge on the Shadow Thieves for casting him out.~
@9434 = ~He began to disrupt their trade. He knew their movements and snared their routes like a rabbit's trail. Hunting them down to kill and steal their supplies.~
@9435 = ~Some say he had gone mad in his isolation, making him ruthless with his killings. Dismembering their limbs and displaying them as some kind of trophy to be admired.~
@9436 = ~Countless assassins were sent to stop him, yet they all ended up the same, dead and butchered.~
@9437 = ~The rest of the tale I do not know. He eventually made his way to Beregost, and started the Gorgon's Eye.~
@9438 = ~What do you think made him decide to come north?~
@9439 = ~I assume something reignited his passion for the Kerykeion. Maybe a clue, or a dream. Or maybe it was the thought of using it for revenge against the Shadow Thieves.~
@9440 = ~It seems Baldwin lacked the mental and physical fortitude to properly wield the Kerykeion, resulting in his essence becoming possessed by the remains of the Gorgon Sisters.~
@9441 = ~This was a rather unfortunate event, but fascinating nonetheless. A pity about the staff, but the piece you recieved does appear authentic.~
@9442 = ~Return to the guild and bring it to Rhade. He may be able to tap into its power and make use of it.~
@9443 = ~With Baldwin gone the position of guildmaster will also need to be filled. He had plans to leave you in charge of the guild, and I agree with his decision.~
@9444 = ~Aside from your natural leadership abilities, I can sense something... different about your aura. I believe it to be in all of our best interests to place you in charge.~
@9445 = ~The position is yours if you'll have it. What do you say?~
@9446 = ~I accept your offer and will assume control of the Gorgon's Eye, as its guildmaster.~
@9447 = ~I accept your offer but I am not sure how active of a leader I can be, as I have a different journey that I must take.~
@9448 = ~I have no wish to lead the Gorgon's Eye at this time, so I must decline your offer.~
@9449 = ~Speak with me upon your return and I will discuss our operations at length.~
@9450 = ~Not to worry, the guild is fairly self-sufficient. Speak with me upon your return and I will discuss our operations at length.~
@9451 = ~That is unfortunate, but I sense you have a rather strong destiny leading you towards an important journey. I will say farewell then, and know that the guilds facilities shall remain open to you.~
@9452 = ~Welcome back, Mifune. If you have the time I'd like to go over your new responsibilities as guildmaster.~
@9453 = ~Yes, I am ready to begin directing the movements of our guild.~
@9454 = ~I have a few other things I need to do first.~
@9455 = ~I will go through your officers one-by-one and you can inform me of any adjustments you wish to make regarding their activities.~
@9456 = ~Rigaldo is in charge of all our general thieving activities. This includes pickpocketing, mugging, extortion, blackmail, break-ins and safe-cracking.~
@9457 = ~Would you like his thieves to focus more on upper class targets where both the risk and reward are higher, or to have them stick to the general public where it is safer?~
@9458 = ~Go for the upper class targets. They will have more valuable items that will outweigh the risk.~
@9459 = ~Stick with the general public. There is a lot more marks and less chance of getting caught.~
@9460 = ~Do you want them to forcefully mug as many targets as they can, or spend more time hidden in stealth waiting for the right moment to strike?~
@9461 = ~Have them hit as many targets as possible, even if it means using force.~
@9462 = ~Better to have them stick to the shadows waiting for safer opportunities.~
@9463 = ~Regarding our protection racket, should we stick to the usual threats and blackmail, or use more physical violence if they are unwilling to cooperate?~
@9464 = ~Use violence if necessary. Fear will keep everyone in line.~
@9465 = ~I don't want people getting seriously hurt. Just stick to using blackmail.~
@9466 = ~Alright, that's it for Rigaldo. These instructions seem in line with his thieves abilities and I foresee everything working out fine.~
@9467 = ~Next up is Zeda, our resident smuggler.~
@9468 = ~She mostly operates between Amn and Baldur's Gate to avoid conflict with the other guilds. However, she could further branch out and expand her activities.~
@9469 = ~Keep her operating where she is. I don't want to instigate any more trouble between guilds.~
@9470 = ~Have her expand her operations farther out. The risk is worth it to gain more opportunity.~
@9471 = ~Black lotus has been her most profitable venture since obtaining our new supplier. However, it is much riskier to transport and carries higher penalties than her usual goods do.~
@9472 = ~Do you want her to continue increasing her stock in lotus, or begin to temper her dealings with safer, less valuable items.~
@9473 = ~Have her continue focusing on the black lotus. It's higher profits should make up for any bribes or bail we would have to pay.~
@9474 = ~Have her shift back more to her usual goods. I don't want her taking any unnecessary risk.~
@9475 = ~Alright, I believe she will be pleased with this set of instructions.~
@9476 = ~Your next officer is Liedel. She is in charge of all the bounty hunting and assassination contracts that we receive.~
@9477 = ~There isn't much to direct here as she is fairly self sufficient. You could have her cease assassination work altogether and focus only on live bounties, but doing would create a noticable decrease in our profits.~
@9478 = ~Have her continue the way she is then. She seems to have things under control.~
@9479 = ~I don't want innocent people being killed. Have her stick to the live bounties from now on.~
@9480 = ~I will let her know.~
@9481 = ~Next up is Gilbald and his gamesmen.~
@9482 = ~They currently have their games rigged to payout 20% of their profits. If you increase the payout, more players will likely come to gamble, but less coin will be gained from each.~
@9483 = ~If you decrease the payout, less players will come to gamble, but the ones who do will end up losing more. The difficulty lies in finding the right balance between the two.~
@9484 = ~Keep the payout at 20%. It seems to be working fine as is.~
@9485 = ~Increase the payout to 30%. Having more players coming in should be more profitable in the long run.~
@9486 = ~Decrease the payout to 10%. I want to milk as much money from those suckers as I can.~
@9487 = ~Alright, I will let Gilbald know of your decision.~
@9488 = ~Your last officer that needs direction is, Madam Meredia, who is in charge of our courtesan wing.~
@9489 = ~If we increase her rates it will attract less patrons overall, but the ones that do come would be wealthy and clean.~
@9490 = ~If we decrease her rates, more clients will come, but they will bring a higher risk of violence and disease. This could cause her staff to be unable to work for longer periods of time.~
@9491 = ~No need to change their rates then. Keep them as they are now.~
@9492 = ~Increase her rates. I wish them to have better quality clients who pose less risk.~
@9493 = ~I want to decrease her rates so we'll have more paying clients coming in.~
@9494 = ~Alright, that is all I have for you at this time. I will make the rounds every 7 days to collect our profits. Come see me then and I will let you know how things faired.~
@9495 = ~There is still some time left before our reports are in. I will keep you updated if anything else requires your attention in the meantime.~
@9496 = ~Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. I've just finished making the rounds and all of your officers reports are in.~
@9497 = ~Based off your instructions and our guild expenses, we have netted a nice sum of profits.~
@9498 = ~How much will I be receiving?~
@9499 = ~Your guild is operating at a low level of risk and has managed to bring in a total of 750 gold coins. Would you like to make any changes to our activites?~
@9500 = ~I will keep them as they are for now.~
@9501 = ~I'd like to change their set of instructions.~
@9502 = ~Your guild is operating at a moderate level of risk and has managed to bring in a total of 1500 gold coins. Would you like to make any changes to our activites?~
@9503 = ~Your guild is operating at a high level of risk and has managed to bring in a total of 2000 gold coins. Would you like to make any changes to our activites?~
@9504 = ~Very good. Report back to me in one week's time.~

//h_smuggd.d......@9600 - @9799

@9600 = ~I pick things up and I put things down. Just not in the same spot is all.~

//h_thamud.d......@9800 - @9999

@9800 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. How are you faring this evening?~
@9801 = ~Uh... pretty good?~
@9802 = ~I am well. Care to explain what that was about?~
@9803 = ~Who are you and how is it you know my name?~
@9804 = ~Excellent.~
@9805 = ~Of course, where are my manners?~
@9806 = ~My name is Thamuz, and I represent an organization known as the Shadow Thieves.~
@9807 = ~Why did you kill Nagate? I thought you were meeting with him to negotiate a deal?~
@9808 = ~So, you are the one called Thamuz, are you? Baldwin mentioned that you two were comrades once.~
@9809 = ~Why did you attack us in Beregost?~
@9810 = ~That was me negotiating. I am now in possession of the item I came for, and he is unable to speak of our encounter.~
@9811 = ~Did he now? There was a time we regarded eachother as such, yes. But those days are buried in the past.~
@9812 = ~I would not expect you to understand the intricacies of our operations. However, seeing as though you will not survive this meeting, I will enlighten you on a few truths.~
@9813 = ~We've allowed Baldwin to play his little game in Beregost because, quite honestly, he's been no threat to our organization. There isn't a single move he has made that we haven't been aware of.~
@9814 = ~The reason we intervened was two-fold.~
@9815 = ~We could not allow Baldwin to obtain the Kerykeion, for he would become a far greater threat to this world than you could imagine. Also, it seems you have made another enemy, who is paying us quite the prize to exterminate you from Beregost.~
@9816 = ~Who is this other enemy you speak of?~
@9817 = ~What do you know of Baldwin's plans for the Kerykeion?~
@9818 = ~Let us finish this then. Prepare yourself, Shadow Thief.~
@9819 = ~Your death may be a certainty but I will not speak aloud such details.~
@9820 = ~Bah! You do his bidding with total ignorance of the outcome you will receive. The Kerykeion cannot be wielded by any mortal, it will twist the mind and mutate the body of any who attempt it.~
@9821 = ~Once reassembled, its power would instantly engulf his being. The amount of destruction his berserk state will inflict would be catastrophic.~
@9822 = ~Yes, enough words. I will avenge my comrades with your death.~

//h_tuztdd.d......@10000 - @10199

@10000 = ~Lookee what we have here boys! A second-rate bounty hunter thinkin' they can come and steal our catch?~
@10001 = ~Go on now, we got to her first. Ain't no room here for you milk-drinkers!~
@10002 = ~I will not stand by while this defenseless girl suffers. Leave at once or I'll be forced to take action.~
@10003 = ~I didn't come all this way to watch you walk away with my prize. Step aside and I won't have to kill you.~
@10004 = ~What did you call me, you dumb hick! I'm going to enjoy slaughtering you animals.~
@10005 = ~I'd say don't make me laugh but... Haw haw!! And here I thought this would be just another boring fetch job. Come on boys, let's teach this brat a lesson!~

//h_vapuld.d......@10200 - @10399

@10200 = ~Sorry friends, but I can't offer any services as of yet. I am still in training while completing my penance.~
@10201 = ~That is quite alright, Vapula. Tell me, what is it you are repenting for?~
@10202 = ~I don't think your're going to finish your training, Vapula. I've come to collect your bounty.~
@10203 = ~If you know my name then you know my crimes.~
@10204 = ~I knew this day would come sooner or later. I am not afraid. If death is my final atonement then I will gladly give my life.~
@10205 = ~So be it. Prepare yourself then, and I will send you to your god presently.~
@10206 = ~Hold on now. What made you betray your guild in the first place?~
@10207 = ~Someone had to stand up to the evil we were committing. I could not allow another innocent person to be killed or mugged over nothing but measly coin!~
@10208 = ~I decided to turn on my guild, and was reborn under the light of Lathander.~
@10209 = ~If I was able to find you, there will surely be others. They will not stop until you are dead.~
@10210 = ~No more words, Vapula. Let us end this.~
@10211 = ~Allow me to flee then! I will travel the southern roads and aid those in need. If you bring back my pendant, they will surely believe me dead.~
@10212 = ~Alright, I will do as you ask. Good luck to you, Vapula, and safe travels.~
@10213 = ~Sorry, Vapula, but it's too risky to let you live.~
@10214 = ~A trial by combat then, under the watchful eyes of the gods! Let them judge whose cause is more righteous!~
@10215 = ~Thank you, friend. I will never forgive myself for my past sins, but at least I can dedicate my future to making ammends.~

//h_xevecd.d......@10400 - @10599

@10400 = ~Don't you look down on me! I'll be richer than the Silvershields come soon enough.~
@10401 = ~I don't think you'll live long enough to see that.~
@10402 = ~You have been accused of using fake gold at the Gorgon's Eye hideout. What do you have to say for yourself?~
@10403 = ~I won't just roll over and die so you can steal MY gold! I earned it fair-and-square from the skills I wield with a blade!~
@10404 = ~Yeah? Well, we'll just see about that!~
@10405 = ~That is absurd. I have done no such thing!~
@10406 = ~You used it at both Gilbald's and Meredia's and it appears to lead directly back to you.~
@10407 = ~Then allow me to examine some of the gold you are carrying.~
@10408 = ~I don't believe you. Time to die!~
@10409 = ~I spent some time there the other night, I won't deny it. Yet, I am not *that* foolish to openly use fake coins in such an establishment.~
@10410 = ~Fine, but if you try to pull a fast one on me, I'll cut your fingers clean off! You got me? *shows you his gold*~
@10411 = ~I knew it! See? All of these coins are fake.~
@10412 = ~What! That is impossible!...~
@10413 = ~I have been deceived! How could I be so foolish? I knew something was off about that woman, but she flashed those coins in my face and I lost all sense!~
@10414 = ~Regardless of intent, you have used counterfeit gold and the punishment is death.~
@10415 = ~What woman are you talking about?~
@10416 = ~She was the woman who hired me! We finalized our contract at Gilbald's last night, but I never got her name or where to find her.~
@10417 = ~She wanted me to kill a young woman by the name of Sam, who is residing in Nashkel. She gave me a large payment up front and promised a substantial amount more after I finished.~
@10418 = ~Alright, Xevec, I believe you. I will look into this further but if I find out you're lying, then you're a dead man.~
@10419 = ~I don't have time for all that. Time to die, Xevec!~
@10420 = ~I'm not lying! I promise! She made it sound as if she knew Sam personally. Seek out the mark and you may find the woman close by.~
@10421 = ~Let's have it then! There's a reason my skills are so desired!~
@10422 = ~What now? I told you it wasn't my fault!~
@10423 = ~You were right. I found the woman who hired you.~
@10424 = ~I'll be back later.~
@10425 = ~That is great news! I knew you would clear my name.~
@10426 = ~Well, not quite. Regardless of intent, you have used counterfeit gold and the punishment is death.~
@10427 = ~I will still have to inform Gilbald of your involvement and he will decide your fate.~
@10428 = ~I understand. Gilald is a reasonable man. When he hears the facts I'm sure he will show benevolence in his ruling.~

//h_yumild.d......@10600 - @10799

@10600 = ~There's a small tunnel in the trees behind Feldepost's! My friends and I like to throw rocks down there sometimes.~
@10601 = ~One night, we got reeeally close and started hearing strange noises coming out of it. When we took a closer look, a bunch of shadowy ghosts came flying out! Now we're too scared to go back.~

//h_zedadd.d......@10800 - @10999

@10800 = ~I'm grabbin' myself a bow and heading for cover! I'm not much of the fighting type.~
@10801 = ~*sniff* *sniff* Hmmm. You smell of books... and blood.~
@10802 = ~I grew up on the streets of Westgate and was sailing spice into Cormyr by the time I was 9. I learned a lot in those days. If you're ever in need of my skills, trust that I shall deliver.~
@10803 = ~I'll keep that in mind.~
@10804 = ~I'm looking for something to do. Do you have any work available?~
@10805 = ~I want to play Bag of Mysteries again!~
@10806 = ~I met a woman in Nashkel who is looking to get her and her son smuggled into Athkatla. Is that something you can help her with?~
@10807 = ~Didn't ya hear what I said? Of course I can! As long as she has the coin that is. Send them my way and I'll set them up with a proper escort.~
@10808 = ~Bored already, are you? You're starting to sound just like Liedel. Never liked that woman, got a funny smell about her.~
@10809 = ~Anyways, my work ain't the kind you can just jump into. However, I do have a game we could play, if you're looking to pass the time.~
@10810 = ~What's the game?~
@10811 = ~I'm not interested.~
@10812 = ~I call it, Bag of Mysteries! I will put you through a series of 4 riddles. For each one that you answer wrong, you will have to give me, say... 100 gold.~
@10813 = ~For each one that you guess right, however, you will get a random prize from my Bag of Mysteries. Once we begin you *must* commit to answering all 4 riddles before the game will end.~
@10814 = ~Bag of Mysteries? Alright, I'll play your little game.~
@10815 = ~It seems I don't have enough gold to play your game.~
@10816 = ~Are you serious? *laughing* How are you this far along without having 400 gold pieces on you?~
@10817 = ~This will be fun! Let us begin.~
@10818 = ~You are seated in a dark room with only a single match. Around you lies a candle, a wood stove and an oil lamp. Which do you light first?~
@10819 = ~The candle.~
@10820 = ~The wood stove.~
@10821 = ~The room.~
@10822 = ~The match.~
@10823 = ~The oil lamp.~
@10824 = ~Really? *shakes her head* That was supposed to be an easy one. Well, pay up then.~
@10825 = ~Hehe, good job! That was an easy one! Here, stick your hand in the Bag of Mysteries and pull out your first prize. Which pocket would you like to check?~
@10826 = ~Left.~
@10827 = ~Right.~
@10828 = ~Top.~
@10829 = ~Front.~
@10830 = ~Secret.~
@10831 = ~*laughing* I hope you enjoy your prize. Onto to the next riddle!~
@10832 = ~There are three priests who all say Destin is their brother. Yet, Destin says he has no brothers. Who is lying?~
@10833 = ~No one.~
@10834 = ~The priests.~
@10835 = ~Destin.~
@10836 = ~You.~
@10837 = ~*shakes her head* No one was lying. The priests are Destin's sisters. Time to pay up.~
@10838 = ~Correct! The priests are Destin's sisters. Take another pull from the Bag of Mysteries! Which pocket would you like to check?~
@10839 = ~I break, but never fall. And I fall, but never break. What are we?~
@10840 = ~Windows.~
@10841 = ~Raindrops.~
@10842 = ~A pair of mirrors.~
@10843 = ~Gusts of wind.~
@10844 = ~Two birds flying.~
@10845 = ~Day and night.~
@10846 = ~A fever and its cure.~
@10847 = ~A broken heart and a person in love.~
@10848 = ~Different temperatures.~
@10849 = ~That is incorrect. A day breaks but not falls, and a night falls but not breaks. That'll be 100 gold please.~
@10850 = ~A day breaks and a night falls, yet they can not be reversed. Well done. Time for your reward! Which pocket would you like to check?~
@10851 = ~I can't be seen but I can be heard. I won't answer back until you've spoken a word.~
@10852 = ~A dream.~
@10853 = ~A voice.~

@10862 = ~Nice job, <CHARNAME>, way to end strong. This is your last pick, so make it count! Which pocket would you like to check?~
@10863 = ~I hope you had as much fun as I did. Time to go refill my Bag of Mysteries for my next victim!~

@11000 = ~Shoo, shoo! Away with you.~
@11001 = ~Oh, my! Visitors! I don't have anything to offer you, except a warning to watch your step while back here, the ground has become quite uneven. You must be here regarding my offer?~
@11002 = ~Yes I am. Tell me what it is you need me to do.~
@11003 = ~Actually, I'm here to kill you. Your last victim escaped and placed a bounty on your head. I'll be glad to take it!~
