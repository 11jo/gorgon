@200000=~Born into the unforgiving alleyways of Selgaunt, a city where wealth and poverty are two sides of the same tarnished coin, Liedel began life as a nameless orphan, a waif of the streets. Her earliest memories were painted with the harsh brushstrokes of urban survival, where the dance of shadows was her only constant companion. Yet, even in the depths of destitution, Liedel's cunning and resilience shone like the brilliance of raw gems.

It was a merchant family, the Javaliens, who first saw the spark of potential in Liedel's street-smarts. They took her from the gutters and offered her a semblance of family, nurturing her inherent shrewdness into a formidable tool for business. Under their tutelage, she learned to navigate the treacherous seas of commerce, gaining expertise in the realms of information brokerage, negotiation, and the subtle art of manipulation.

As Liedel's ambitions grew, she found herself conscripted into the ranks of the Scepters, Selgaunt's city watch. There, she carved out a reputation as an effective tracker of criminals and an intelligence gatherer. Yet, the rigid ethics of law enforcement chafed against her nature, and the allure of Selgaunt's underworld soon drew her away from the path of sanctioned justice.

Joining the ranks of the Night Knives, Liedel found her true calling. She thrived in the guild's complex hierarchy, honing her skills in stealth, misdirection, and strategic deception. She became a master of her craft, a puppeteer who pulled the strings in a theater of shadows. But the guild's ruthless nature eventually led to a schism within her soul.

When ordered to execute a former Scepter ally, Liedel's inner turmoil erupted into violent retribution against the guild itself. With her betrayal exposed, she fled, chased by the vengeful Night Knives until the blades of Rigaldo, from of the Gorgon's Eye, intervened. This encounter steered her life in a new direction as she pledged allegiance to this new guild, finding refuge and a renewed sense of purpose within its ranks. Her alliance with the Gorgon's Eye marked her transformation from prey to predator, a declaration of her refusal to be subjugated by her past.

It was within the shadows of the Gorgon's Eye that Liedel's path intersected with the player's, a fellow guild member. Their shared thirst for adrenaline and adventure sparked a romantic entanglement that propelled them into a partnership of heart and spirit. Together, they embarked on a journey to explore the depths of their bond and the exhilarating unknowns of the world beyond.~
