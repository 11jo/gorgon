@2000 = ~Those who serve the Lord of Shadows do not share secrets with those uninitiated in our ways. So tread carefully, for these shadows watch and remember.~
@2001 = ~It is in the interest of discretion and duty that I must refrain from speaking further. Until you walk among us, our conversation ends here.~
@2002 = ~Brethren of the Gorgon's Eye, shadows grace your endeavors, and now, so does the Church of Mask. I am Danika, a newly ordained Demarchess of our Lord of Shadows.~
@2003 = ~As your ally and guide, my role is to infuse our operations with divine purpose, ensuring they are not only successful but also a testament to our devotion.~
@2004 = ~Our Lord favors subtlety and cunning, qualities I too hold dear. I look forward to working closely with you, and imparting the wisdom of our faith.~
@2005 = ~Together, under the watchful gaze of Mask, we shall redefine the art of thievery and make the Gorgon's Eye a name revered and respected in equal measure.~
@2006 = ~Saradin mentioned a potential collaboration between us. What's your perspective on this?~
@2007 = ~I'm interested in learning more about the Church of Mask.~
@2008 = ~In practical terms, what can you offer, and how can I utilize your skills and services?~
@2009 = ~I'd like to know more about you, Danika. Anything you'd like to share?~
@2010 = ~I appreciate your time, but I need to take my leave. There are matters I need to attend to.~
@2011 = ~What shadows weigh upon your thoughts, and how may the guidance of Mask's servant aid you on this intricate path?~
@2012 = ~I would like you to join me, if you're still willing. Your expertise and training could greatly enhance our efforts.~
@2013 = ~May the shadows guide your steps, faithful one. When you require guidance or seek the unseen, know that I shall be here, veiled by the night's embrace, ready to impart the wisdom of Mask upon you.~
@2014 = ~Ah, a seeker of hidden truths in the world of shadows. It's a rare thing to encounter someone eager to peer behind the veiled curtain of the Church of Mask.~
@2015 = ~Tell me, what particular strand of this intricate web draws your curiosity? What knowledge is it you wish to unveil?~
@2016 = ~Can you provide a brief history of the Church? How has it evolved over time?~
@2017 = ~What are the core beliefs and tenets of the Church of Mask?~
@2018 = ~How is the Church of Mask structured? What are the different roles and hierarchies within it?~
@2019 = ~What kind of activities does the Church engage in? How do they execute their plans and heists?~
@2020 = ~What are some of the rituals and ceremonies unique to the Church of Mask?~
@2021 = ~What kind of magic is associated with the Church? Are there any spells or abilities I could learn?~
@2022 = ~How does the Church of Mask interact with other deities and their followers?~
@2023 = ~I'd like to ask you about something else.~
@2024 = ~The Church of Mask, veiled in secrecy, has a long and shadowy history, deeply entrenched in the fabric of Faerun. From the time of shadows, it has been a sanctuary for those who thrive in the dark.~
@2025 = ~Initially, the Church was more openly involved in political schemes and grand-scale plots. However, after the Time of Troubles and the rise of Cyric, our focus shifted.~
@2026 = ~We delved deeper into the shadows, refining our methods to be more personal, elusive, and centered on individual and small group activities.~
@2027 = ~This evolution was necessary to survive the changing landscape of divine and political powers. Our history is a tale of adaptation and survival, a testament to the enduring nature of shadows.~
@2028 = ~The Church of Mask is built on the belief that the world belongs to the cunning, the stealthy, and the resourceful.~
@2029 = ~We hold that ownership is a fluid concept, defined by possession rather than law or tradition. The art of deception, the skill of subtlety, and the ability to manipulate are virtues we cherish.~
@2030 = ~Wealth is seen as something that rightfully belongs to those who can acquire it skillfully.~
@2031 = ~Our tenets encourage us to end each day wealthier than we started, not through brute force, but through cleverness and stealth.~
@2032 = ~Honesty, to us, is less a virtue and more a tool for creating a facade, a mask, if you will, to achieve our ends.~
@2033 = ~At its core, we are a congregation of individuals who embrace the art of stealth, secrecy, and subtlety.~
@2034 = ~Our ranks are comprised primarily of thieves, clerics, and specialty priests, among whom I count myself.~
@2035 = ~Within our walls, titles like 'Hidden Ones', are held by esteemed members like my master, Saradin, signifying the revered high priests of our order.~
@2036 = ~They are the guiding shadows, the unseen hands that shape our path. But our structure is not just confined to temples and dark sanctuaries.~
@2037 = ~In the bustling cities, you'll find Catfoots, clergy members who blend seamlessly with the urban shadows, gathering intelligence, offering counsel, and aiding fellow thieves.~
@2038 = ~The Nightrunners follow a different path, roaming the wilderness and exploring dungeons. They're our eyes and ears in the wild, demonstrating that Mask's blessings extend far beyond the city walls.~
@2039 = ~Each of us, regardless of our title or role, is proficient in skills that honor Mask. Be it the arts of disguise, forgery, or even reading lips, we are trained to embody the essence of our deity.~
@2040 = ~So, you see, whether it's the hidden corridors of a temple or the untamed wilderness, the Church of Mask thrives through adaptability, skill, and a deep understanding of the shadows that we call home.~
@2041 = ~Our activities are as varied as the shadows we dwell in. Primarily, we engage in espionage, thievery, and subtle manipulations.~
@2042 = ~We plan our operations meticulously, often involving elaborate heists, information gathering, and infiltration. Our methods are indirect, preferring to remain unseen and uncaught.~
@2043 = ~The Church's operations are designed to be ghostly whispers in the dark, leaving no trace yet having profound effects. Every action, every theft, every secret gathered is a tribute to Mask.~
@2044 = ~Our practices are as enigmatic as our deity. The Ritual of the Unseen Presence is a sacred observance where we acknowledge Mask's omnipresence in darkness.~
@2045 = ~In this solemn ceremony, we offer stolen wealth to Mask, melting it down before our altars as a tribute.~
@2046 = ~Another significant tradition is the Ritual of Shadow Walking, a sacred ceremony that allows a follower to attune themselves with the essence of shadow itself.~
@2047 = ~These sacred ceremonies, like many of our practices, are shrouded in secrecy and performed under the guard of conjured shadows, ensuring their sanctity and confidentiality.~
@2048 = ~We use spells that enhance our stealth, deceive others, and manipulate shadows. Spells like Dark Way, Listening Shadow, and Striking Shadows are part of our repertoire.~
@2049 = ~These abilities allow us to meld into darkness, eavesdrop undetected, and strike from the shadows.~
@2050 = ~As for learning these spells, it requires dedication to Mask and an understanding of the subtlety of shadows.~
@2051 = ~Our interactions with other deities and their followers are, like much of our work, complex and multifaceted.~
@2052 = ~Our interactions with other deities and their followers are a nuanced web of alliances and enmities. Perhaps the most notable is our profound animosity towards Cyric.~
@2053 = ~This deep-seated hatred stems from a dark chapter in our history. During the Time of Troubles, Mask, in the guise of Godsbane, was wielded by Cyric to slay Bhaal, the Lord of Murder.~
@2054 = ~However, Mask's intricate scheming led to a catastrophic error.~
@2055 = ~He inadvertently aided Cyric in seizing the portfolio of illusion and, worse, lost a significant part of his own power, including the portfolio of intrigue.~
@2056 = ~This blunder not only weakened Mask but also fueled a relentless vendetta against Cyric. Beyond this rivalry, our deity's penchant for intrigue has, at times, put us at odds with others.~
@2057 = ~Mask has sought alliances, notably with Bane, though such overtures are met with wariness due to our god's reputation.~
@2058 = ~We find opposition from deities like Waukeen and Helm, and others like Deneir, Oghma, Torm, Tyr, and Selune have worked to thwart Mask's plots.~
@2059 = ~Simultaneously, our relationship with Shar is complex, as our domains overlap in areas of darkness and secrecy.~
@2060 = ~Though Mask is typically a loner in the pantheon, the nuanced association with Shar is based more on mutual understanding of the shadows than outright alliance or enmity.~
@2061 = ~These dynamics illustrate the delicate balance of power and influence we navigate in our interactions with other divine entities and their followers.~
@2062 = ~Our church must be as cunning and adaptable as the shadows we revere, forever vigilant in a world where alliances shift as quickly as the darkness itself.~
@2063 = ~My offerings to the Gorgon's Eye are akin to a guiding shadow, providing strategic counsel and insights that can elevate our operations to new heights.~
@2064 = ~With my understanding of subterfuge and the teachings of Mask, I can offer unique perspectives that can turn the tide in complex situations.~
@2065 = ~Firstly, my training has honed my ability to analyze and interpret situations with a depth that few can match.~
@2066 = ~This means I can provide invaluable advice on the planning and execution of heists or missions, foreseeing potential pitfalls and opportunities that might otherwise be missed.~
@2067 = ~Secondly, my knowledge of the Church of Mask and its workings can be an asset in understanding the broader landscape of power and espionage in Faerun.~
@2068 = ~This information can be crucial in anticipating moves by our rivals or even by those who might wish to ally with us.~
@2069 = ~Knowledge, as they say, is power, and in our world, it can mean the difference between success and failure.~
@2070 = ~Moreover, I bring a spiritual element to our endeavors. My prayers and rituals, though they may seem abstract, are dedicated to earning the favor of Mask.~
@2071 = ~This could manifest in subtle ways, perhaps a fortuitous shadow to hide in, a distraction at the right moment, or even a feeling, an intuition that guides you when choices are hard to make.~
@2072 = ~In addition, I can offer training in the arts of stealth and subterfuge to our members.~
@2073 = ~The skills I possess in evasion, disguise, and quiet movement are invaluable for anyone wishing to excel in the art of thievery.~
@2074 = ~So, while it may seem that my role is intangible, the benefits I bring are woven intricately into the fabric of our operations.~
@2075 = ~My presence here is to ensure that every action we take is not only physically executed with precision but is also strategically sound and blessed by the shadows.~
@2076 = ~Together, we can achieve greatness, with each theft and scheme not just an act of larceny, but a masterful dance in the dark, orchestrated with the wisdom and blessing of Mask.~
@2077 = ~I'd like to know more about you, Danika. What can you tell me about yourself?~
@2078 = ~Oh, you're curious about me? Well, it's not often someone inquires about my personal story, but I guess I can share what's relevant.~
@2079 = ~I come from the land of Thay, where I was trained in the arts of stealth, strategy, and the sacred mysteries at one of our many temples.~
@2080 = ~There, I honed my skills in espionage, the interpretation of secrets, and the intricate rituals of Mask.~
@2081 = ~This rigorous training forged me into a Demarchess, adept in the subtleties of our faith and the practicalities of our clandestine work.~
@2082 = ~Upon my ascension to the higher ranks of our Church, they chose to send me here to the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2083 = ~Under the tutelage of my master, Saradin, my mission is to weave the will and wisdom of Mask into the guild's strategies, enhancing our operations with divine insight and shadowy cunning.~
@2084 = ~I've only been here a short time, still adapting, and still observing, but every step I take, every decision I make, is a reflection of my training and my devotion to Mask.~
@2085 = ~I am here to serve, to teach, and to learn, always under the watchful gaze of my master and our enigmatic deity.~
@2086 = ~He has discussed this with me, and I find the prospect in line with my duties and training as a Demarchess of Mask.~
@2087 = ~As a representative of the Church, it is part of my mandate to not only spread the influence of our Lord of Shadows but also to apply the skills and teachings I have acquired in practical settings.~
@2088 = ~Understand that my involvement is a reflection of my devotion to Mask and the path laid out for me as a Demarchess. Together, we can navigate the challenges ahead, guided by the tenets of my faith.~
@2089 = ~So, while my joining you is born of duty, I will endeavor to ensure that our collaboration is effective and that our actions serve both our immediate goals and the greater purposes of the Church.~
@2090 = ~Your skills and dedication to your faith are clear, Danika, and I'd like for you to join me.~
@2091 = ~I'm curious about your personal feelings on this. Are you comfortable with this arrangement, beyond just fulfilling your obligations?~
@2092 = ~I appreciate the offer, however, I think it's best if we continue as is for the time being.~
@2093 = ~My personal feelings? That's... not something I'm often asked about. In truth, my life has always been guided by the will of others.~
@2094 = ~I've learned to adapt and excel in the roles assigned to me, to find a sense of purpose within the directives I'm given.~
@2095 = ~This new position, working alongside you, is another such directive. I am prepared to fulfill it to the best of my abilities, as I have always done.~
@2096 = ~Your concern for my comfort is... unnecessary. I will carry out my duties with dedication and efficiency. The teachings and trainings of the Church have shaped me to be resilient and focused.~
@2097 = ~However, I do appreciate your inquiry. It's... unexpected, but not unwelcome. It's just that in the life I've led, personal comfort has never been a priority.~
@2098 = ~My attention has always been on serving the greater purpose, on fulfilling the needs of the Church, and now in this new capacity, supporting our joint endeavors in the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2099 = ~I understand your decision. My duty is to be an asset in whatever way is most beneficial, and I'm prepared to fulfill that role as needed.~
@2100 = ~Should circumstances change or should you require my assistance in the future, do not hesitate to call upon me.~
@2101 = ~For now, I will focus on my current responsibilities and ensure that my presence here continues to align with the goals of our Lord of Shadows and the Gorgon's Eye.~
@2102 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I accept your invitation to join you. Together, I believe we can achieve much, blending the arts of stealth and strategy with your own talents.~
@2103 = ~I am ready to embark on this journey and contribute to our shared goals under the guidance of Mask. Let us see where the shadows guide us in this new endeavor.~
@2104 = ~I wasn't certain if our paths would cross again so soon. If you're considering whether to have me rejoin your party, know that I remain ready to serve.~
@2105 = ~My dedication to our shared goals has not wavered, and I can pick up where we left off without hesitation.~
@2106 = ~However, the choice is yours. I am prepared to contribute as before, should you decide my skills are needed once more.~
@2107 = ~I've given it some thought, and I realize your skills are vital to our success. I'd like you to rejoin the party, Danika.~
@2108 = ~I appreciate your willingness, Danika, but I think the current team setup is working well for us. It's best if things stay as they are for now.~
@2109 = ~Understood. I will continue my duties independently then. The path of Mask often requires us to walk alone, and I am no stranger to that.~
@2110 = ~Should you find the need for my skills in the future, do not hesitate to seek me out. I wish you success on your journey and will remain vigilant in my own pursuits.~
@2111 = ~Your decision to have me return is acknowledged. I shall resume my role with the same dedication and efficiency as before.~
@2112 = ~Our objectives remain clear, and I am prepared to utilize my skills in the service of our shared goals. Let us proceed with the tasks at hand, ensuring our success under the guidance of Mask.~
