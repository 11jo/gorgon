@1000=~Born in the harsh alleyways of Selgaunt, Liedel, an orphan, survived the tough streets with cunning and resilience. The merchant family Javaliens, recognizing her potential, nurtured her into a savvy business strategist. She later joined Selgaunt's city watch, the Scepters, excelling in criminal tracking but felt restricted by their rigid ethics.

Liedel eventually joined the Night Knives, thriving in their ranks before a moral conflict forced her to betray them. Pursued by them, she was saved by Rigaldo of the Gorgon's Eye, leading her to pledge allegiance to this new guild. Her skills grew, turning her from prey to predator.

In the Gorgon's Eye, Liedel met the player, a fellow guild member. Their shared passion for adventure led to a close partnership, embarking together on a journey of discovery and exploration.~
@1001=~Even shadows retreat when the light is too harsh; we must withdraw!~

@1003=~I am a creature of the shadows, not of this insipid play. Change course, or lose me.~
@1004=~I'll lead us into temptation, and oh, how sweet it will be.~

@1012=~In the night's name, we strike with deadly grace!~
@1013=~Oh, the sweet rush of impending conflict!~
@1014=~Let's mix a little pleasure with our pain, shall we?~
@1015=~Embrace the darkness; let our enemies cower before us!~
@1016=~Let's show them the might of shadows and steel!~
@1017=~So... this is the final thrill...~

@1034=~The allure of the chase, heightened by a miss... Enticing.~
@1035=~You resist my touch, but let's see how you handle my... other tricks.~
@1036=~Even my pockets have their limits. No more room for trinkets... or temptations.~
@1037=~Your secrets are mine.~
