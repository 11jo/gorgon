@28500 = ~Aye, friend, this ain't a place for the faint of heart. Best find yourself a different pastime, yeah? Keep it movin'.~
@28501 = ~You must be the new blood, eh? Welcome to the pits. I'm Diomedes, and this here is my esteemed companion, Shadow. Don't let her charming looks fool ya, she's got a keen eye for a good fight.~
@28502 = ~You run the show here, Diomedes? What exactly are the pits?~
@28503 = ~Who is the current champion of the arena?~
@28504 = ~How does your work here tie in with the operations of the Gorgon's Eye?~
@28505 = ~What's the story behind your cat? She looks like she's seen her fair share of action.~
@28506 = ~I'm looking to prove myself in the pits. How can I get in on the action?~
@28507 = ~I'll be going now.~
@28508 = ~Champion of the arena, a title not easily won or kept. Currently, it's held by Roran, a ruthless fighter who crushes his opponents without mercy.~
@28509 = ~And before him, there was Isla Darkcloak, a legend in her own right. She was a force to be reckoned with, combining strength and technique in a way I've seldom seen.~
@28510 = ~Now, she's retired, leaving behind a legacy that's hard to match. If you aim to challenge Roran, you'll need to be prepared for a brutal fight.~
@28511 = ~Ah, Shadow, she's been with me for longer than I care to remember. Found her in the back alleys of Beregost, a scrawny thing barely clinging to life. Nursed her back, I did.~
@28512 = ~Since then, she's been my constant companion, never leaving my side, especially in the thick of battle.~
@28513 = ~She's got a keen sense for danger, that one. Saved my hide more times than I can count. In a way, she's the true heart of these pits, always watchful, always alert.~
@28514 = ~Plain and simple, the pits are a two-fold operation. They bring in a steady stream of gold, primarily from bets and an eager crowd.~
@28515 = ~And they also serve as a training ground for Gorgon's Eye members, a place where potential recruits can earn their place.~
@28516 = ~Established guild members also come down to hone their skills, and learn a thing or two from my fighters. Combat training, discipline, and a taste for blood. It's all forged right here.~
@28517 = ~The pits are a battlefield, a duelin' arena, a place where two combatants square off, and have a dance of iron and skill.~
@28518 = ~But mind you, it's not about death matches here. It's about honin' one's abilities, pushin' the limits, and showin' the world what a true fighter's made of.~
@28519 = ~We forge strength, sharpen minds, and temper spirits. It's more than just a stage for combat. It's where we find our real selves, and learn what we're truly capable of.~
@28520 = ~Eager, aren't ya? I like that. Before you dive in, it's wise to get a lay of the land. Speak to some of the fighters, get a sense of the rhythm and the tricks of the trade. It'll serve you well.~
@28521 = ~Once you reckon you've got a grip on things, come back to me, and we'll get you sorted for a match. Remember, patience and knowledge are just as vital as iron in these pits.~
@28522 = ~You've got that look in your eye, like you're after somethin'. What's it then, lookin' to throw down in the pits, or you just after some intel?~
@28523 = ~I'm ready to step into the arena, Diomedes. Let's do this.~
@28524 = ~Are there any rules I should be aware of?~
@28525 = ~Are there any rewards for participating in the fights?~
@28526 = ~I've come to check on Shadow. How's she doing today? Mind if I give her a little scratch?~
@28527 = ~Aye, the rules are simple, but they're crucial to the very foundation of what we do here. No magic, and no killin'.~
@28528 = ~It's not about sorcery or death, you see. We're here for the raw skill, the art of combat. Magic tends to tip the scales, and we want a fair fight.~
@28529 = ~Now, as for death strikes, it's not that we shy away from intensity. Far from it. But we're not executioners. We're here for fierce battles, not for senseless bloodshed.~
@28530 = ~So, remember these rules well. They're the backbone of what we do here in the pits. They ensure that every victory is earned, every defeat a lesson, and every match a true spectacle.~
@28531 = ~There certainly are. First and foremost, there's the invaluable experience gained from each bout. There's no substitute for the lessons learned in the heat of battle.~
@28532 = ~And for those who prove themselves, there's a share of the profits. You see, we're not just here for sport, we're here to entertain, and the crowd is more than willing to show their appreciation.~
@28533 = ~You've got a good eye for company, mate. Cats have a way of finding the right folks. Just be gentle with her, yeah?~
@28534 = ~Ready to dive into action then? Now, that's the spirit! Let's not waste any time then.~
@28535 = ~Remember how we do things. No magic, we keep it old school. And no killin' blows, we're here for sport, not bloodshed.~
@28536 = ~Now, get your gear sorted and let's step into the arena.~
@28537 = ~Let's go.~
@28538 = ~On second thought, I need a little more time to prepare.~
@28539 = ~For your first go, we'll pair you up with Khalid. He's got a knack for uncovering a fighter's weaknesses. Gotta see what you're made of, after all.~
@28540 = ~You'll be facin' Grom, next. He's a force to be reckoned with, a different kind of beast. Be ready for a battle.~
@28541 = ~You're starting to draw a crowd now, <CHARNAME>. People are starting to hear about the new blood taking down all my fighters. Let's not disappoint them, shall we?~
@28542 = ~Alright then. Brace yourself, you're facing Lyria Winterheart. She's a wily one, so keep your guard up.~
@28543 = ~Your next challenge will be Serra Swiftwind, the cloaked archer. Keep your wits about you, for she's as sharp as her arrows. Good luck, my friend.~
@28544 = ~You've come a long way, and now you face the pinnacle of the pits. Roran 'Iron Fist' Stonebreaker, the reigning champion.~
@28545 = ~He's a force of nature, a monk with fists that could shatter stone. Be on your guard, and fight smart. This won't be an easy bout.~
@28546 = ~From the moment you stepped into these pits, I saw something special in you. You've proven me right in the most spectacular way.~
@28547 = ~Defeating Roran, the reigning champion, is no small feat. You've surpassed all expectations.~
@28548 = ~There's no one left in the pits to challenge you, except for Isla, but she's long since retired.~
@28549 = ~She became one of the most notorious assassins and sell-swords the Sword Coast has ever seen. No one knows where she is now, not even me.~
@28550 = ~She left it all behind, vanished into the shadows. Finding her won't be easy, but if you're set on proving yourself, she's the one you'll have to convince.~
@28551 = ~By the gods, you've done the impossible! You've managed to convince Isla to return to the arena! I never thought I'd see this day.~
@28552 = ~It's been years since I've allowed deathmatchs in these pits, but for two champions of this caliber... it's an opportunity too grand to pass up.~
@28553 = ~This will be a battle for the ages, a clash that will echo through the annals of pit-fighting history.~
@28554 = ~When you're ready, champion, just say the word, and we'll make our way to the arena. The pits are waiting, and so is Isla. This is history in the making.~
@28555 = ~I'm ready, Diomedes.~
@28556 = ~I need a litte more time to prepare.~
@28557 = ~Remember, champion, this is a fight to the end. Show the world your true abilities.~
@28558 = ~Well, I'll be damned. You came into these pits a mystery, a nobody. Look at you now. You've climbed the ranks, defeated some of the toughest fighters around, and even took down Isla herself.~
@28559 = ~You're not just a champion, my friend. You're a legend. And that's not something I say lightly. Here's your well-deserved prize money. You've earned every coin.~
@28560 = ~Wear your title with pride, Champion. The pits will never forget your name.~
@28561 = ~Remember, champion, you've etched your name into the history of these pits. The legend of your triumph will echo through the ages.~
@28562 = ~Take your spoils and wear your title with pride. Until we meet again in the arena!~
