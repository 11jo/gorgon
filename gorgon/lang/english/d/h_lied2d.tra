@43500 = ~Thought you could sneak up on me, Shadow Thief? Time to meet your end!~ [h_lied60]
@43501 = ~<CHARNAME>! Do you have a death wish? What in the seven hells are you doing sneaking up on me like that? I was this close to making you a permanent part of the scenery here!~
@43502 = ~Just testing your reflexes, Liedel. You're as quick as they say.~
@43503 = ~Apologies, Liedel. I didn't mean to startle you.~
@43504 = ~What the hell was that? You almost gave me a new breathing hole!~
@43505 = ~Well, you certainly got my heart racing, I'll give you that. I'll admit, I'm relieved to see you in one piece.~
@43506 = ~No harm done, love. You certainly have a way of making an entrance. I'll admit, I'm relieved to see you in one piece.~
@43507 = ~You should know better than to sneak up on an assassin, love. I'll admit, I'm relieved to see you in one piece.~
@43508 = ~Now, why are you here, <CHARNAME>? After nearly giving me a heart attack... you must have a good reason.~
@43509 = ~I came to see you, Liedel. I was worried about you after the attack.~
@43510 = ~If you'd prefer some solitude, I can leave. I didn't mean to intrude on your moment.~
@43511 = ~To be honest, I didn't expect to find you here, but after what happened, I'm glad I did.~
@43512 = ~I... was worried about you too. In truth, I found myself here, lost in thoughts of you amidst the turmoil.~
@43513 = ~It seems our concerns mirrored each other, a rare connection in our world of veiled emotions.~
@43514 = ~No, I... I'm glad you're here. Solitude has its place, but right now, your presence is more comforting than any silence could offer.~
@43515 = ~I'm glad you did, too. Fate works in mysterious ways, doesn't it? Casting us into each other's orbit when we least expect it, but perhaps when we need it most.~
@43516 = ~After the attack, finding solace seemed like a distant dream, yet here you are, turning it into a reality. I, too, am glad for this unexpected encounter.~
@43517 = ~When you left to fight the Shadow Thieves, I needed some solace, and this place... it brings me a strange kind of comfort.~
@43518 = ~Ah, so the fearsome assassin has a soft spot after all. Who would have thought?~
@43519 = ~It's nice to know someone's got my back. Especially in times like these.~
@43520 = ~Save your worries, Liedel. I can handle myself just fine.~
@43521 = ~Don't get used to it. I have a reputation to maintain, you know.~
@43522 = ~We're in this together, aren't we? I wouldn't want my partner in crime to get soft on me now, would I?~
@43523 = ~You've got a couple tricks up your sleeve, I'll give that, love. Nothing I couldn't manage, of course.~
@43524 = ~Actually, <CHARNAME>, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about...~
@43525 = ~Well... look up at the sky first, will you? The stars... they're quite remarkable from down here, aren't they?~
@43526 = ~They remind me of my childhood, all alone on the streets of Selgaunt. They were my silent companions, always offering a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness.~
@43527 = ~And tonight... they appear to be especially beautiful.~
@43528 = ~It's a wonderous sight, Liedel... but their not quite as beautiful as you are.~
@43529 = ~You're right, they are quite something, aren't they?~
@43530 = ~Well, as much as I'd love to stargaze all night, I've got some things I need to do.~
@43531 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. Duty calls, as always. Until next time.~
@43532 = ~And by the way, it might do you some good to pay more attention to what's right in front of you, instead of always looking to the horizon. Goodbye.~
@43533 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@43534 = ~(Lean in, pressing your lips to hers.)~
@43535 = ~Mmm, <CHARNAME>... That was... more delightful than I could have imagined.~
@43536 = ~Twice now, you've managed to catch me off guard this night. I suppose that's one thing I can always count on when you're around. Life is never dull.~
@43537 = ~Our time together, it's been... rather enjoyable, a rare blend of excitement and connection, don't you think?~
@43538 = ~It's been more than enjoyable, Liedel. You've become something special in my life.~
@43539 = ~Well, I must admit, it's been quite the thrilling ride, and I'm eager to see where it leads.~
@43540 = ~Liedel, our time together has been unique, in a good way, and I'm truly glad we met.~
@43541 = ~I... I feel the same way, <CHARNAME>. You've brought something exhilarating into my world, and I find myself... caring for you.~
@43542 = ~In a world where trust is as elusive as a wisp of smoke, finding enjoyment in someone's company like this, it's quite the treasure.~
@43543 = ~It's a sensation I wasn't prepared for, yet here I am, drawn to you in a way that goes beyond our shared shadows.~
@43544 = ~In our line of work, where every emotion is often masked and every alliance temporary, this feeling for you stands out as something genuine, something vivid.~
@43545 = ~It's as if amidst all the intrigue and duplicity, we've found a semblance of truth in each other. And that, <CHARNAME>, that is both rare and precious.~
@43546 = ~But, as much as I wish we could linger in this moment, duty calls us back to the guild. Our lives are bound to the shadows we navigate, after all.~
@43547 = ~Let's return, holding onto this rare truth we've found in each other. I've had a amazing night, <CHARNAME>, and there's a comfort in knowing that amidst the chaos, we have this...~
@43548 = ~Until our next rendezvous, my dear companion.~
