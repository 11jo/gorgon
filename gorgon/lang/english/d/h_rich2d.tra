@56000 = ~<CHARNAME>! The plan was a failure. We must eliminate this abomination before it's too late! My rogues will aid you in securing the rest of the guild.~
@56001 = ~If this creature should manage to escape, Faerun's fate will be sealed.~
@56002 = ~The Kerykeion's power must have been more potent than we foresaw, allowing him to transform into that... monstrosity.~
@56003 = ~Nevertheless, Baldwin now lies defeated, and the Kerykeion has disintegrated beyond repair.~
@56004 = ~The final authentic fragment, however, has been kept in my possession, hidden for years.~
@56005 = ~My brother has soiled any significance it once held. I will offer it to you as a token of gratitude for your assistance, and as an effort to move past our shared history.~
@56006 = ~Rhade will stay behind and orchestrate the preparations for the guild's closure and the subsequent transfer of assets.~
@56007 = ~We have efficiently evaluated the Gorgon's Eye worth and are prepared to promptly allocate your share.~
@56008 = ~With this, I extend my regards and bid you a good day.~
@56009 = ~Baldwin, enough! Take hold of your senses and cease this folly at once!~
@56010 = ~Ah, my dear brother, here to witness my ascent into godhood, are you? How considerate.~
@56011 = ~Godhood? Are you mad! I've come to stop you, and to take ownership of the Kerykeion.~
@56012 = ~Surrender it, and I will bring you in before the Shadowmaster. There may still be mercy.~
@56013 = ~Do you take me a for a fool, brother? After all these years, the Kerykeion is finally within my grasp.~
@56014 = ~And here you stand, offering me your dungeons... when I could have the world, instead!~
@56015 = ~Do not let the pull of the Kerykeion consume you! Relieve yourself of its grasp, and we will somehow find a path back from this madness.~
@56016 = ~Ah, the voice of reason speaks! But it's far too late for that, the power is mine now, and with it, I shall have my retribution.~
@56017 = ~It was a dream we both shared once, do you remember? Or is even that lost to you now, along with your honor, after betraying your own brother!~
@56018 = ~I have not forgotten. Yet, I cannot say the same for you.~
@56019 = ~It is you who are lost, brother. Ensnared in the malevolent embrace of the Kerykeion, and from it, you've emerged a dark taint of delusion.~
@56020 = ~You butcherd your kin. Cut them down like helpless dogs. There was no desire for retribtion in your eyes, only malice.~
@56021 = ~You remain restrained by fear, lacking ambition, and that is why you will fail. You are still the same coward as you were on the day of banishment.~
@56022 = ~Comrades, ready yourselves for battle! <CHARNAME>, protect me while I finish preparing the Kerykeion for fusion!~
@56023 = ~...~
@56024 = ~So, this is what it's come to, <CHARNAME>?~
@56025 = ~Baldwin, your guild betrays you. <CHARNAME> has seen through your delusions and fights alongside us.~
@56026 = ~Rhade, a plant in your organization since the dawning of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@56027 = ~As for the rest of you, I give you this chance to join with us and strike down your master! He is only exploiting you for his own selfish desires!~
@56028 = ~<CHARNAME>, it's not true is it? How could you do this to your own guild!~
@56029 = ~I knew I smelled somethin' funny on you when you first walked in here!~
@56030 = ~If it weren't for Baldwin I'd still be out on the streets. I'll die before I let this guild fall into the hands of you lot!~
@56031 = ~Betrayal, <CHARNAME>? Leading our foes to the heart of our sanctum? Such treachery cuts deeper than the sharpest blade. You've sealed your fate with this folly.~
@56032 = ~Remember, in the shadowed world we tread, every step is watched, every act remembered. You were once a commendable member of our fold, but this... this double-cross is a sin beyond redemption.~
@56033 = ~The shadows may forgive, but we, the Gorgon's Eye, do not.~
@56034 = ~Finally, some action around here! Sorry, Baldwin, but I think it's time for me to switch things up a bit.~
@56035 = ~Consider this my formal resignation from the Gorgon's Eye.~
@56036 = ~I sensed you harbored secrets, <CHARNAME>, but Eury? That was beyond my reckoning.~
@56037 = ~Heh. I'll take that as a compliment.~
@56038 = ~Shall we get to it then?~
@56039 = ~It matters not how many of you turn coat against me. Your futile efforts have granted me ample time to complete my arcane preparations!~
@56040 = ~You shall all kneel before me as I ascend to the echelons of godhood!~
@56041 = ~Dark sisters, I free you from your bonds! Grant me your eternal power!~
@56042 = ~AaaAAHHHH!!!~
