@19500 = ~Ah, welcome to my humble abode. I'm not accustomed to receiving guests unannounced, but I'm always open to new faces. What brings you to my doorstep today?~
@19501 = ~Greetings Borland. I've come to make arrangements regarding your future contributions to the Gorgon's Eye.~
@19502 = ~I'm here to put an end to your operation, Borland. It's time to close down, for the good of everyone.~
@19503 = ~Apologies, wrong residence. Please excuse the intrusion.~
@19504 = ~Oh, I see. No harm done, stranger. It's easy to lose one's way around here. If you're ever in need of a place to rest or just a friendly chat, my door is always open to travelers.~
@19505 = ~Future contributions to the Gorgon's Eye, is it? I assure you, you must be mistaken in your visit. I'm just a humble host to travelers.~
@19506 = ~Dealings with a guild like yours aren't exactly in my ledger. I think there's been some misunderstanding here.~
@19507 = ~Surely, a man of my simple means wouldn't be on your radar for... contributions, as you put it.~
@19508 = ~Cut the act, Borland. Your little side business hasn't gone unnoticed. The Gorgon's Eye wants in on your spice trade. Pay up, or shut down.~
@19509 = ~You've been dealing spice without our consent. Let's find a middle ground where you continue your business with the Gorgon's Eye's oversight.~
@19510 = ~I'm not here to threaten, Borland, but your spice trade raises concerns. We suggest a contribution of your profits for our partnership.~
@19511 = ~Absolutely not! This is my home, my business, and I've built it from the ground up! How dare you barge in here demanding a share of what I've worked so hard to create!~
@19512 = ~You think you can just waltz in and take a cut because you call yourselves the Gorgon's Eye? I don't care for your threats or your offers of 'oversight'.~
@19513 = ~I've operated just fine without your consent, and I intend to keep it that way. This is extortion, plain and simple!~
@19514 = ~Refusing our offer might lead to an unfortunate show of force. It's better to comply and avoid a physical demonstration of what happens when you defy us.~
@19515 = ~Analyze your situation critically. By defying the Gorgon's Eye, you risk everything. Our oversight offers protection and stability, it's a strategic alliance.~
@19516 = ~Aligning with us isn't just about submission; it's about foreseeing the path ahead. Wisdom is knowing when to adapt. It could be more beneficial than you realize.~
@19517 = ~Imagine the growth and influence your business could achieve with us by your side. We're offering you a chance to expand, not just survive.~
@19518 = ~I can see there's no flexing against the muscle of the Gorgon's Eye. It's a hard pill to swallow, being strong-armed like this. But what choice do I have?~
@19519 = ~The pressure of your strength is undeniable, and it leaves me with little room to maneuver. Perhaps there's some logic in yielding, but it's a difficult thought to entertain.~
@19520 = ~Outsmarted at my own game... that's hard to swallow. The logic of your position is clear, albeit infuriating. I see no benefit in resisting a force that has outthought me. ~
@19521 = ~You've painted me into a strategic corner, and it's irksome to be outplayed at my own game. While it galls me to consider it, perhaps there's a practical side to your proposal.~
@19522 = ~Hmm... Your perspective forces me to look beyond the immediate, though it's against my instincts. There's sense in your words, even if it chafes to admit it.~
@19523 = ~The prospect of gaining broader perspectives and guidance does have its appeal. It might be wise to consider the long-term benefits of this partnership.~
@19524 = ~Hmm... Charmed or coerced, I can't quite tell which. It's vexing to be swayed against my better judgement, but I find myself pondering the potential benefits, despite myself.~
@19525 = ~Is there merit in this partnership you propose? It's a bitter pill, but I see no other way out.~
@19526 = ~Here I am, faced with decisions that I never imagined I'd have to make. This 'partnership' with the Gorgon's Eye, it's clear now, is not a matter of choice but of necessity.~
@19527 = ~I'll agree to your terms, but it's an agreement born from pressure, not mutual respect or desire. I'm doing this to protect what I've built, though it feels more like capitulation than cooperation.~
@19528 = ~Let's proceed then, with this arrangement, and see where it leads us.~
@19529 = ~Glad you're on board, Borland. We look forward to a prosperous relationship.~
@19530 = ~It's a smart move, Borland. This partnership will be mutually beneficial.~
@19531 = ~Wise decision, Borland. But remember, we're watching. Any slip-ups, and you'll find us less than forgiving.~
@19532 = ~I suppose there's no turning back now. This partnership, if we can call it that, marks a significant shift in how I've always operated.~
@19533 = ~While I can't say I'm entirely pleased with these new terms, I understand the necessity given the circumstances.~
@19534 = ~I'll make the necessary preparations for our arrangement and brace for the changes ahead.~
@19535 = ~Let's just hope that this alliance brings more than just oversight and that the promises of stability and growth aren't hollow.~
@19536 = ~So, this is the hand I've been dealt. Forced into a corner, with little choice but to agree to your demands. Against the might of the Gorgon's Eye, my options are limited.~
@19537 = ~I'll ensure your collections are as timely and complete as you demand. Though coerced into this agreement, I can only hope it doesn't spell the ruin of everything I've built.~
@19538 = ~You'll have your share, as agreed, but know that this 'partnership' was never my choice.~
@19539 = ~You come into my home, making demands and threats, and expect me to bow to your will? Your words have no sway here, and your attempts to intimidate and persuade me are laughable at best.~
@19540 = ~You've gravely underestimated who you're dealing with. Do you know who I am? Borland of Beregost is not some lowly street merchant to be bullied by the likes of you!~
@19541 = ~I have connections, deep within the City Watch, officials whose loyalty I've secured. They turn a blind eye to my operations, ensuring my business thrives without interference.~
@19542 = ~You thought you could just walk in and take a slice of my empire? What a fool! Zylark! Show yourself and handle this intruder! Teach them the price of meddling in the affairs of Borland!~
@19543 = ~By the gods... I never thought... Zylark was one of the best, and yet you... you dispatched him so easily. I see now that I've severely misjudged the situation and underestimated you.~
@19544 = ~Please, let's not have any more bloodshed. I'll agree to your terms. Whatever the Gorgon's Eye demands of my operation, I'll comply. Just... no more violence.~
@19545 = ~Ah, it's you again. I haven't forgotten our 'arrangement', don't worry. The contributions are being made as agreed, though I can't say I'm pleased about it.~
@19546 = ~End my operation? Oh, you must mean my little hospitality business. How dreadful that offering weary travelers a free place to rest could be seen as such a terrible thing.~
@19547 = ~Surely, you're not here to shut down a man's charitable deeds?  All I have here are open doors and warm beds for those in need.~
@19548 = ~The Gorgon's Eye is aware of your spice trade. It's harming the community, and it's time you stopped.~
@19549 = ~Cut the act, Borland. Your spice dealings are interfering with the Gorgon's Eye's operations. Shut it down now, or we'll do it by force.~
@19550 = ~You come into my home, wielding the name of the Gorgon's Eye as if it were some sort of royal decree, expecting me to cower and comply?~
@19551 = ~I've built this operation from nothing, and I won't be bullied into submission, not by you or your guild.~
@19552 = ~You think you can just waltz in here and dictate terms? I've faced challenges before and I'll face this one head-on too. The Gorgon's Eye may be a force in this town, but so am I.~
@19553 = ~I won't be dismantled by threats or coerced into fear. You've picked the wrong man to intimidate.~
@19554 = ~The strength behind the Gorgon's Eye is not to be underestimated. We can, and will, dismantle your operation if you force our hand. It's in your best interest to shut down now.~
@19555 = ~Think logically about this. Continuing your trade under these circumstances only invites risk and conflict. Shutting down is the smart move, both for your safety and your future prospects.~
@19556 = ~Borland, consider the wider implications. Continuing this path leads to inevitable downfall. It's not just about today; it's about your long-term well-being.~
@19557 = ~Let's approach this with mutual understanding. Shutting down this side business preserves your reputation and spares you from a conflict you can't win. It's the more favorable path.~
@19558 = ~Borland, if you won't shut down willingly, perhaps the City Watch should know about your Black Lotus trade. Close down now or face legal consequences.~
@19559 = ~Your show of force is unsettling, to say the least. I built this business to stand on its own, not to be threatened into submission. Yet, the power you wield isn't something I can ignore.~
@19560 = ~It's a hard truth to face, but maybe shutting down is the lesser of two evils. I need to consider this carefully.~
@19561 = ~You make a logical argument, more's the pity. It's frustrating to admit that continuing might bring more harm than good.~
@19562 = ~My pride wants to fight, but my mind sees the sense in your words. Shutting down might indeed be the smarter choice.~
@19563 = ~You're forcing me to look at the bigger picture, something I've been avoiding. While I resent the suggestion, I can't deny the wisdom in your foresight.~
@19564 = ~The future does look bleak if I continue as is. This decision isn't easy, but I need to ponder the potential outcomes.~
@19565 = ~Your words are persuasive, and that bothers me. I wanted to protect what I've built, not dismantle it.~
@19566 = ~Yet, the way you put it, shutting down could actually preserve my standing in the long run. It's a bitter pill, but maybe it's the right one. I need to weigh this option.~
@19567 = ~Well, after mulling over what you've said, as much as it grates against me, I see that I have little choice. You've backed me into a corner and made valid points I can't just ignore.~
@19568 = ~So, I'll shut down the operation. It's not a decision I make lightly, and it's certainly not one I'm happy about. But it seems to be the only sensible course of action under the circumstances.~
@19569 = ~You've won, and my business, as you so forcefully pointed out, has to end.~
@19570 = ~I'm glad you're seeing reason, Borland. It's for the best. This decision will benefit you and the community in the long run.~
@19571 = ~It's a wise choice, Borland. Shutting down this operation is the right move under these circumstances.~
@19572 = ~Finally, you come to your senses. Just remember, we will be watching. Any attempts to restart this operation, and it won't end so nicely.~
@19573 = ~ I'll shut it down, but don't think this has earned you or the Gorgon's Eye any respect. You've strong-armed a hardworking man out of his livelihood.~
@19574 = ~Now, get out of my sight before I reconsider my compliance with your so-called 'reasonable' demands.~
@19575 = ~So, it's done. I'll close my operation, but mark my words, the Gorgon's Eye and you, its puppet, will get no gratitude from me. You've crushed what I've built with threats and intimidation.~
@19576 = ~Here, take the last of the lotus. This is all that's left of what I had. Now, I've done what you've asked, so I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my property. There's nothing more for you here.~
@19577 = ~You think a little show of muscle can scare me into closing shop? I've dealt with bigger threats than you, and I'm still standing. Your attempt at intimidation is more pitiful than persuasive.~
@19578 = ~Your reasoning falls flat, I'm afraid. Did you really think a few logical points would sway me? I've been in this business long enough to know better than to fold at the first sign of trouble.~
@19579 = ~Foreseeing doom and gloom, are we? I find your so-called 'wisdom' quite laughable. I've navigated tougher situations than this. Your warnings are nothing but empty words to me.~
@19580 = ~Your charm won't work on me. I've heard smoother talkers than you, and I haven't budged. It's almost funny how you thought you could sway me with sweet words. You're out of your depth.~
@19581 = ~All this talk, all these threats and attempts at persuasion, and you think you have the upper hand?~
@19582 = ~Let me enlighten you. The City Watch? They're in my pocket, and they turn a blind eye to my operations. You're not just up against me; you're up against a network that you can't hope to topple.~
@19583 = ~You've made a grave mistake coming here and making enemies out of people like me. You're outmatched and outplayed. Zylark! This fool's time has come to an end. Take care of them.~
@19584 = ~I haven't forgotten what transpired between us. The operation has been ceased, just as you demanded. It's a bitter pill to swallow, closing down what I've built, but it's done. Happy now?~
