@65500 = ~Master Thaldor, let us continue this discussion in a more private setting, away from prying ears.~
@65501 = ~Good evening, Master Thaldor. I trust your journey from Mirabar was uneventful?~
@65502 = ~Indeed, Captain. The roads were clear, and the shipment remains secure. These weapons are of the finest Mirabaran steel, untainted by the cursed ore plaguing the Sword Coast.~
@65503 = ~Excellent news. The Flaming Fist is in dire need of such armaments. Our troops have been sorely lacking in reliable equipment as of late.~
@65504 = ~Rest assured, the supply is substantial. Enough to outfit an entire battalion, if need be.~
@65505 = ~We shall have them unloaded at the northern gates of the city and ready for inspection by the morrow.~
@65506 = ~Very well. I trust the usual arrangements have been made regarding payment?~
@65507 = ~Indeed, Captain. Your agent in Mirabar has sorted out the details of compensation. You'll find the terms most agreeable.~
@65508 = ~Good. This transaction serves the interests of both Mirabar and the Flaming Fist.~
@65509 = ~Let us hope this venture is met with success. We will not soon forget this favor, Master Thaldor.~
@65510 = ~Nor shall Mirabar, Captain. Our alliance is one forged in steel and mutual interest. May our endeavors be prosperous.~
