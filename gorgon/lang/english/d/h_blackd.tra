@15500 = ~'Bout time someone stumbled into our little party. Saves us the trouble of huntin' down fresh meat.~
@15501 = ~Fancy a dance, do ya? Well, it'll cost ya, won't it? Cough up your valuables, nice and easy-like, and we might let you toddle away in one piece.~
@15502 = ~You're treading dangerous ground here. You and your lot should think twice before making enemies of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@15503 = ~Enough chit-chat, Blackthorn. Let's start the violence, shall we? Draw your shiv, and let's tango!~
@15504 = ~You're in league with the Gorgon's Eye, then, are ya? I've danced with a lot worse than you lot, I'll tell ya that.~
@15505 = ~I'll say it again, hand over your valuables, or this night'll get proper nasty for ya.~
@15506 = ~You're making a grave mistake, lad. I'm thinkin' you won't live long enough to see the mornin' sun!~
@15507 = ~We're giving you a chance to slip away with your skin intact. Cross us again, and the next time, it won't be a polite suggestion.~
@15508 = ~How about you ditch the child's play and pledge your shiv to the Gorgon's Eye? It would be in your best interest.~
@15509 = ~Link up with the Eye, eh? I'll admit, the prospect has its allure, but I ain't exactly one for takin' orders, yeah?~
@15510 = ~I've always been a bit of a lone wolf, see, playin' by my own rules, making my own way. It's not just about the freedom, it's about trust, too.~
@15511 = ~If you can't take orders, you're just another loose cog in the machine, and that won't fly.~
@15512 = ~No one's askin' you to be a lackey, Blackthorn. The Gorgon's Eye offers opportunities, not just orders.~
@15513 = ~You'll regret passin' over this chance. We don't just steal scraps from the streets, we control the whole damn game.~
@15514 = ~I'll give you this, mate, the notion's got me thinkin'. The Eye's got a reputation, and I reckon you've earned it in some fashion.~
@15515 = ~Blackthorn, you're a capable rogue, but imagine what you could achieve under the Gorgon's Eye banner.~
@15516 = ~You've got skills, Blackthorn, but you're just scratching the surface. Join us, and you'll see the real power and influence we wield.~
@15517 = ~You're wasting your talents here. The Gorgon's Eye offers true power and wealth. Don't be a fool, Blackthorn, seize this chance.~
@15518 = ~On second thought, Blackthorn, I may have overestimated your value. Let's skip the pleasantries and get right to the violence.~
@15519 = ~Why'd I be botherin' to take my business elsewhere? This district suits me just fine, it does. And as for handlin' the likes o' you lot, don't think you'll be scarin' me off so easy.~
@15520 = ~Feelin' lucky, are ya? Alright then, mate. Draw your shiv and let's see who's left standin'!~
@15521 = ~Crossing the Gorgon's Eye is a death sentence. We don't forget, and we don't forgive. Leave now, while you still have a choice.~
@15522 = ~This district's got its share of shadows, but it's overflowing. Seek a place where your skills won't go to waste.~
@15523 = ~Look, I've been carvin' my slice here for a while, and it's been good. But maybe you're onto somethin'.~
@15524 = ~See, it's a squeeze in this joint, and you're no run-of-the-mill geezer. I'm thinkin' it's high time for a switch-up, find a different gutter to call home.~
@15525 = ~I'll be off then, scoutin' for a nest that suits our kin best. You won't be catchin' sight of us 'round these parts again.~
@15526 = ~Up for a little shadowplay, are we? Blades out, mate. We'll see who's got the slickest moves in the alley.~
@15527 = ~Alright then, consider me in. I've had my fill of playin' lone wolf. Let's see what the Gorgon's Eye has in store, shall we?~
@15528 = ~Oi, look at me now, ain't I the new bloke in charge? City Watch Commander, that's me. Never thought I'd see the day, truth be told.~
@15529 = ~She's as quiet as a grave now. No more chit-chattin' from her.~
@15530 = ~Good work, Blackthorn. You're turning out to be a real asset to the Eye. <CHARNAME> made a wise choice bringin' you in.~
@15531 = ~Cheers, boss. It's a real bleedin' pleasure. Solid crew, and plenty of action. Feels like home, yeah?~
@15532 = ~That's the spirit, lad. You've proven yourself capable enough. Keep showin' that kind of loyalty, and there'll always be a place for ya.~
@15533 = ~Been more than happy to spill a bit o' blood for the cause. The Gorgon's Eye's got me bloody back, it does.~
@15534 = ~Alright then, mate. Kick back to your usual duties, and keep that edge keen, you hear?~
@15535 = ~You got it, boss. I'll be watchin' the shadows, ready for whatever rolls our way.~
