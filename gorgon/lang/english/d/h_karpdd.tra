@42000 = ~Looks like we'll be gettin' a good harvest this year, thank the gods for that. Now, what is it I can help you with?~
@42001 = ~I'm here about the rings you've found, Karp.~
@42002 = ~Rings, you say? I'm not sure I follow you, stranger. There's been nothin' but turnips and the like from these fields. But you... you don't look like any simple buyer or farmer. Who sent you here?~
@42003 = ~The folks I deal with know better than to send someone who sticks out like a sore thumb. And you sure don't match the description of the buyer I was expectin' from Ulgoth's Beard.~
@42004 = ~You best explain yourself quickly, 'cause I don't take kindly to uninvited questions about my personal affairs.~
@42005 = ~I'm not asking, Karp. Give me the rings, or things might get unpleasant. Consider this your only warning.~
@42006 = ~Think about what your husband would do if he found out about your dealings. Want to avoid that? Give me the rings.~
@42007 = ~The road from Ulgoth's Beard was fraught with danger. Bandits left me looking rougher than intended.~
@42008 = ~I can't help but wonder why you're selling these rings under the table. What are you afraid of, Karp?~
@42009 = ~Wait, wait! Just hold on a moment, please! Don't do anything rash. Let... Let me explain, just give me a chance!~
@42010 = ~These rings, they're all I have to get away from here. My husband, he's... he's not a good man. He beats me, and my boy too.~
@42011 = ~I've been selling whatever I can find in the fields, trying to scrape together enough to flee south, to Athkatla. My sister, she's willing to take us in. I can't stay here, not any longer.~
@42012 = ~Please, you have to understand, I'm doing this for my son, to give us a chance at a better life, away from the violence and fear. I'm begging you, have some mercy.~
@42013 = ~Your story is unfortunate, Karp, but it changes nothing. Hand over the rings now, or you'll deeply regret it.~
@42014 = ~Maybe I can help you get to Athkatla, and in return you can provide me with the rings.~
@42015 = ~Alright, alright! I'll give you the rings. Just take them and go. I can't risk you or anyone else getting violent. My boy... I have to think about him. Please, just leave us be after this.~
@42016 = ~Smart decision, Karp. It's good you chose to comply without further fuss. I'll be taking these off your hands now.~
@42017 = ~I doubt that's all you've been hiding. Hand over everything else you've found buried around here, or you'll find out just how unpleasant I can get.~
@42018 = ~Just take them and go! G-get away from me!~
@42019 = ~You're taking everything from us, aren't you? F-fine, take it all, you... you monster!~
@42020 = ~Help me... get to Athkatla? I must admit, I didn't expect an offer like this.~
@42021 = ~Look, I'm wary of strangers bearing promises, but if you truly can find a safe way for me and my boy to reach Athkatla, then... I'd be willing to part with the rings.~
@42022 = ~But not before. They're all I have right now. Once I'm safely away from here, away from him, the rings are yours.~
@42023 = ~I'll be around here in the meantime, tending to the farm.~
@42024 = ~Bandits, you say? That's unfortunate, but these roads can be treacherous. I must admit, you're not quite what I was expecting, but these are strange times indeed.~
@42025 = ~You claim to be the buyer, and while I have no reason to doubt you, understand my need for some reassurance. These dealings are delicate, after all. You do understand my position, don't you?~
@42026 = ~If I were not the intended buyer, how would I know of the rings' existence? The improbability of a coincidence here speaks to the truth of my claim.~
@42027 = ~Wisdom guides us to expect the unexpected, especially on treacherous roads. Let's not allow unforeseen complications to cloud our purpose here.~
@42028 = ~Your caution is understandable, but let me assure you, my intentions are as clear as they are sincere. Let's proceed with trust and see this arrangement to a successful end.~
@42029 = ~I'm sorry, but something here just doesn't add up. You claim to be the buyer, yet something about this meeting feels amiss.~
@42030 = ~If you truly are who you say you are, then you would know the answer to a simple question. It's a code we agreed upon, a little security measure.~
@42031 = ~So, tell me, what did one snowman say to the other snowman? Only the true buyer would know the answer to this.~
@42032 = ~I'm having a meltdown!~
@42033 = ~I've got a frosty feeling about this...~
@42034 = ~We are stuck in a bloody snowglobe!~
@42035 = ~Smells like carrots.~
@42036 = ~Ice to meet you.~
@42037 = ~Let's roll.~
@42038 = ~Forget this game, Karp. I'm not here to play riddles. Hand over the rings now or things are going to get unpleasant.~
@42039 = ~You're not who you claim to be, are you? I don't know what you're after, but you won't find it here.~
@42040 = ~I suggest you leave now, before I take this matter to someone who can deal with liars and thieves. Don't test my patience any further.~
@42041 = ~I apologize for the deception, Karp. My intentions aren't to harm you. I'm genuinely curious about these rings and why you've been so secretive about them.~
@42042 = ~Enough of this charade. I'm not leaving here without those rings. Hand them over swiftly, or you'll find that my patience has run dangerously thin.~
@42043 = ~You really are the buyer from Ulgoth's Beard. My apologies for being cautious, but I suppose one can't be too careful these days.~
@42044 = ~Now, let's get down to business. Here are the rings, and I'll accept 1000 gold in return, as agreed upon. Let's make sure this transaction goes smoothly.~
@42045 = ~Here's the 1000 gold as agreed. Pleasure doing business with you.~
@42046 = ~The broker who arranged our meeting will handle the payment. They'll ensure you get what's due once I confirm the rings are genuine.~
@42047 = ~Alright then, I suppose that makes sense. The broker did mention something about handling the finances. Just make sure they know the deal is done and the rings are with you now.~
@42048 = ~Your sudden honesty is as surprising as it is suspicious. But since you know about the rings, I might as well tell you the whole truth.~
@42049 = ~These rings, they're more than just buried treasures. They're my only hope for a better life. My husband, he's... he's cruel, to me and our boy.~
@42050 = ~He knows nothing of these rings, and that's how it must stay. I've been secretly selling what I find to save enough to flee to Athkatla, where my sister has promised us refuge.~
@42051 = ~That's all there is to it. Now you know, so what's your play here?~
@42052 = ~Thank you, truly. This gold... it's more than just coin to me; it's a chance for a new beginning. I hope these rings serve you well, as they're now a part of my family's hope for a better future.~
@42053 = ~You know, you seem like someone who might have connections. I don't suppose you know anyone reliable who could... discreetly escort me and my son to Athkatla?~
@42054 = ~I have a sister there, and we need to get to her safely. It's a long journey, and the roads can be dangerous. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.~
@42055 = ~I'll look into it and get back to you.~
@42056 = ~Sorry, I'm currently tied up with other pressing matters and can't assist you right now.~
@42057 = ~Oh, thank you! That means more to me than I can express. Just knowing there's someone willing to help gives me hope.~
@42058 = ~Please, let me know if you find anyone. My son and I will be ready to leave as soon as it's safe. You have my deepest gratitude.~
@42059 = ~Oh, you've returned! I've been anxiously awaiting any news. Were you able to find someone to help us travel safely to Athkatla?~
@42060 = ~I'm sorry, I haven't found anyone just yet. I'll let you know as soon as I have something concrete.~
@42061 = ~I have something lined up for you in Beregost. Leave tonight with your son, and you'll be contacted upon your arrival in the city.~
@42062 = ~I understand, these things can take time. I appreciate you not forgetting about us and continuing to look. Please, do let me know as soon as you find a safe way for us.~
@42063 = ~Every day here is a day too long, but knowing there's someone out there trying to help gives me a bit of hope. Thank you.~
@42064 = ~Oh, thank you, truly! You've brought us more than just assistance, you've brought us hope. Here are the rings, as I promised. And, there's something else I'd like you to have.~
@42065 = ~I found it buried in the field over a month ago. It's odd, unlike anything I've ever seen, and no one I've approached could make sense of it.~
@42066 = ~Maybe it's of some value or use to someone with your resources and connections. Consider it a token of my deepest appreciation for your help. Safe travels, and farewell.~
@42067 = ~Words can hardly express my gratitude for what you've done. You've turned what seemed an impossible dream into a hopeful reality. As a token of my appreciation, please, take this.~
@42068 = ~I understand, I won't impose further. Safe travels on your own journeys, and should our paths cross again, perhaps fortunes will align differently. Farewell for now.~
@42069 = ~Just leave me and my boy in peace, that's all I ask!~
@42070 = ~Thank you so much. I'll gather our things and get my boy ready. We'll leave for a better life soon, all thanks to you.~
@42071 = ~I couldn't leave. There wasn't enough coin for both me and my boy, so I sent him ahead to Athkatla. He's safe there now, and that's all that matters.~
@42072 = ~When my husband found out, he... he was furious. He took his anger out on me.~
@42073 = ~Later that night, he went off to the Belching Dragon, got himself good and drunk. The next day, they found him in the river, a nasty wound on his head, drowned.~
@42074 = ~They think he fell in, hit his head on the rocks. I'll stay on the farm for now, just glad my boy is safe...~
@42075 = ~Karp, I thought you'd be on your way to Athkatla by now. Is there something wrong?~
@42076 = ~I'll be going now.~
