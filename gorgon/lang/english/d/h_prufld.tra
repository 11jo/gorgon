@54000 = ~Stars in the sky, flowers in the air... Everything's dancing, don't you see?~
@54001 = ~I can't see any stars because we are inside.~
@54002 = ~Pruflas, lad, what seems to be the problem here? You need to leave this place and return home to your wife.~
@54003 = ~Alright, Pruflas. If reaching nirvana is the only way to get you to leave, then I'll do it.~
@54004 = ~Oh, yes... my wife... brr. Cold steel and bitter words, she is. But in here, it's like a warm embrace. No judgment, just... peace. Can't you feel it too? It's like a dream.~
@54005 = ~Your wife needs you back home, Pruflas. She can't make it on her own.~
@54006 = ~I understand that it feels comforting in here, but you have real responsibilities out there.~
@54007 = ~You're going to feel cold steel in here too if you don't scram!~
@54008 = ~No, I shan't be leaving... not until I've reached nirvana.~
@54009 = ~What are you talking about?~
@54010 = ~I'm not dealing with this.~
@54011 = ~They regard the lotus with disapproval, as if it were a malevolent force. Yet, in reality, it bestows wonder, joy, happiness, and purpose upon life! It's truly magnificent.~
@54012 = ~There exists a state of nirvana attainable with a precise measure of lotus, wherein all truths are laid bare.~
@54013 = ~However, I cannot embark on this journey alone, once I partake in the lotus, its effects slip my memory until they wane.~
@54014 = ~I implore you to administer doses until I achieve the perfect equilibrium. Be cautious not to give too much, for it may lead to my demise, yet too little will be insufficient.~
@54015 = ~It is imperative to strike the right balance. So, if you aid me in attaining nirvana, I pledge to return to my wife.~
@54016 = ~Forget it! I'm not going to help you with this.~
@54017 = ~Alright, sounds simple enough.~
@54018 = ~Well, then, I'm just staying right put until I get there myself.~
@54019 = ~Joyous news! Remember, too little won't be enough, but an excess could be fatal.~
@54020 = ~Should I become entirely incoherent, or begin to lose consciousness, you can use an antidote to bring me back to my senses, and we can start afresh.~
@54021 = ~(Administer a small dose.)~
@54022 = ~(Administer a medium dose.)~
@54023 = ~(Administer a large dose.)~
@54024 = ~I can't help you with this, Pruflas.~
@54025 = ~Sober as a bull, now, Let's give it another crack, shall we?~
@54026 = ~(Use an antidote to return Pruflas to baseline.)~
@54027 = ~If trees could talk, they'd probably gossip about the weather all day. 'Did you hear what that cloud said?'~
@54028 = ~Have you ever seen a snail tap dance? It's quite the spectacle, I assure you.~
@54029 = ~Fish have this mysterious aura, like they're keeping the secrets of the deep sea. What do you think they're hiding?~
@54030 = ~I'm convinced that mushrooms are time travelers from the 5th century.~
@54031 = ~The oak tree...it tells stories in whispers...I'll listen...tomorrow.~
@54032 = ~The fireflies...they painted the night...so sparkly.~
@54033 = ~You know, I once saw a squirrel...it was...so...squirrelly.~
@54034 = ~Clouds are like fluffy...pillows...floating...in the...sky...~
@54035 = ~Mushrooms...umbrellas...for gnomes...and...tiny...gnome...hats...~
@54036 = ~Rocks...patient...like...grandparents...who've...seen...it...all...~
@54037 = ~Fish...great swimmers...never late...for...dinner...parties...~
@54038 = ~Ah, the veils of illusion have lifted, and truth shines through like the first rays of dawn.~
@54039 = ~Owls...hoo...hoot...I'm getting...sleepy..~
@54040 = ~Zzz...zzz...zzz~
@54041 = ~...~
@54042 = ~Un...gh...~
@54043 = ~I see now, the interconnectedness of all things, the grand dance of existence weaving its intricate tapestry.~
@54044 = ~The cosmos speaks in a language of silent understanding, revealing the profound unity of life and spirit.~
@54045 = ~This clarity, it is more than mere perception, it is a transcendent awakening of the soul. I am reborn in the light of this newfound wisdom.~
@54046 = ~Thank you, dear traveler, for guiding me to this state of enlightenment. I shall return to my wife with a heart full of wisdom and gratitude. May your journey be filled with light and purpose.~
