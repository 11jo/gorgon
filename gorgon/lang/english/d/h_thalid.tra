@61000 = ~Hm, you don't quite look like you belong in these shadows. Best turn back. These alleys hold secrets not meant for all eyes.~
@61001 = ~At this time the shadows still lie dormant. The black markets are closed for now. Return after nightfall, and we'll embark on our clandestine journey.~
@61002 = ~What makes the black markets so unique? What could I expect to find there?~
@61003 = ~Are the black markets open to all, or is there a restriction on who can enter?~
@61004 = ~I'm not interested. I prefer to keep my dealings above board.~
@61005 = ~I'll return when the night is at it deepest.~
@61006 = ~You've come to the right shadowed corner, my friend. Not everyone recognizes the signs, but I can tell you're one of us.~
@61007 = ~I'm Thalia, your ticket to the black markets. I know this world, its every hidden nook and treacherous cranny. I know the merchants and their wares, the traps and their cunning mechanisms.~
@61008 = ~We've got a narrow window, though. The markets are only open from midnight till the early hours. Time's precious in our line of work. Ready to step into the shadows?~
@61009 = ~I'm prepared to delve into the shadows. Let's head to the black markets.~
@61010 = ~Ah, back for more, I see. The shadows always hold new secrets to uncover. Are you ready to venture once again into the heart of the black markets?~
@61011 = ~At this time the shadows still lie dormant. The markets are closed for now. Return after nightfall, and we'll embark on our clandestine journey.~
@61012 = ~The black markets, my elusive friend, are the whispered epicenter of intrigue and shadowed dealings within the realm.~
@61013 = ~Picture a world beneath our world, where the flicker of torchlight reveals more than just goods, but the pulsating heart of the unseen.~
@61014 = ~In these winding, narrow alleys, shrouded under the cloak of darkness, you'll find an array of wares diverse as the night itself.~
@61015 = ~Artifacts steeped in ancient magic, tomes filled with forbidden knowledge, potions brewed in secret, and deadly traps, cunningly devised and waiting for the unwary.~
@61016 = ~Each stall is a trove of the extraordinary, delicately crafted for those who thrive in the world of shadows.~
@61017 = ~But, it's not just the tangible you'll find here. Information is a prized commodity, often traded at a higher value than the rarest jewels.~
@61018 = ~Whispers that can dethrone kings, secrets that can start wars, and confessions that can end them, all move silently through these shadowed corridors.~
@61019 = ~So, prepare yourself not just for an exchange of goods, but for an experience that will entwine your fate with the secrets of the night.~
@61020 = ~For in the black markets, every shadow holds a story, and every transaction is a dance with the unknown.~
@61021 = ~Ah, that's the beauty and the mystery of it, isn't it? The black markets are not a place for just anyone. It's a secretive, selective world, a realm that only opens its doors to a chosen few.~
@61022 = ~These shadowed halls and hidden stalls cater to those adept in the art of stealth and subtlety, to the ones who walk the fine line between the seen and unseen.~
@61023 = ~It's a sanctuary for thieves, rogues, and cunning minds, a place where the common man would feel out of place and overwhelmed.~
@61024 = ~Here, in this concealed haven, one must possess not only the knowledge of its existence but also the skill and guile to navigate its intricate web.~
@61025 = ~We thrive in this dance of shadows, where trust is as rare as the most coveted treasures on display. So no, my friend, not everyone can stroll into these markets.~
@61026 = ~It's a world set aside for those like us, who understand and respect the delicate balance of secrecy and survival in our line of work.~
@61027 = ~Very well, the shadows aren't for everyone, and it takes a certain resolve to walk among them.~
@61028 = ~Remember, should you ever change your mind, the hidden alleys and their mysteries will always be there, lurking just beyond the reach of the law.~
@61029 = ~A wise choice indeed. The secrets of the night await your arrival with keen anticipation.~
@61030 = ~Remember, as the clock strikes midnight, the world of shadows comes alive, revealing its forbidden treasures to those brave enough to seek them.~
@61031 = ~Very well. Follow me, and remember, in these markets, discretion is your closest ally.~
@61032 = ~Welcome to the heart of shadows, my friend. Explore, peruse, and indulge, but do so wisely.~
@61033 = ~When you're ready to depart, seek me out. I'll be here to guide you back through the labyrinth of secrets.~
@61034 = ~Back from the depths of intrigue, I see. Whenever you're ready to depart from this realm of shadows, just say the word. I'll ensure you leave as discreetly as you arrived.~
@61035 = ~I've seen all I need to. Let's head back, Thalia.~
@61036 = ~I'm not quite finished here. I'll let you know when I'm ready to leave.~
@61037 = ~Very well. Follow me, and we shall navigate these shadows back to the world above.~
