@51500 = ~Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I must admit, I didn't expect to find you here, <CHARNAME>.~
@51501 = ~It's not often that someone manages to outpace the shadows themselves, no, that's a feat few can boast.~
@51502 = ~But where are my manners amidst such an unexpected turn of events? I am Thamuz, a name you've likely heard whispered in the shadows.~
@51503 = ~I am representative of the Shadow Thieves, an organization that prides itself on precision and discretion.~
@51504 = ~Your swift arrival here speaks to a certain... flair that I can't help but admire. It's a rare occurrence to encounter someone who can match wits with our operations.~
@51505 = ~I was under the impression that negotiations were your goal. What drove you to slay this man before me?~
@51506 = ~Baldwin spoke of you. He recalled a past where you both walked as comrades in the shadows.~
@51507 = ~Why are the Shadow Thieves obstructing Baldwin's quest for the Kerykeion? What's your endgame here?~
@51508 = ~Why the attack on Beregost? Wouldn't a discreet approach to Nagate have served your purposes better?~
@51509 = ~I have no desire to fight you, Thamuz. I plan to stop Baldwin myself, before this impending disaster.~
@51510 = ~It seems our paths are destined to cross blades. Prepare yourself, Shadow Thief.~
@51511 = ~I find it somewhat disheartening, as a fellow practitioner of our shadowed arts, that you'd even need to ask.~
@51512 = ~In our realm, negotiations are often cloaked in duplicity and unpredictability. My methods, while unorthodox, serve a purpose.~
@51513 = ~By removing Nagate, I've eliminated an unpredictable factor, a potential leak in our tightly woven tapestry. He was a loose end, one that needed tying up.~
@51514 = ~What I sought is securely in my grasp, and any details of our exchange have perished with him. In our world, silence is often the most effective form of negotiation.~
@51515 = ~Ah, Baldwin's romanticism of the past. Yes, we were comrades once, allies in a world cloaked in darkness. But allegiances in our line of work are as fickle as the shadows we inhabit.~
@51516 = ~Baldwin chose his path, one that led away from the tenets we once upheld together. Now, we stand on opposite ends, each a reminder to the other of what once was and what can never be again.~
@51517 = ~It's a tale as old as the guilds themselves, a bond built in shadow, only to be severed by differing ambitions.~
@51518 = ~You ask a prudent question, <CHARNAME>. This isn't mere obstruction but an essential countermeasure. Baldwin's fixation with the Kerykeion has rendered him blind to its dire implications.~
@51519 = ~As Shadow Thieves, we grasp the true nature of what he pursues. This artifact isn't a simple tool of power, it's akin to an ancient force capable of warping the very essence of reality.~
@51520 = ~Our objective transcends petty rivalry or the scramble for power. We seek to prevent a disaster that could unravel the very fabric of Faerun.~
@51521 = ~The Kerykeion, in its entirety, possesses the potential to distort reality itself, to bend the wills and fates of all living beings.~
@51522 = ~Baldwin envisions it as his path to supremacy, oblivious to the fact that it is also a gateway to widespread ruin.~
@51523 = ~Thus, we intervene, not merely as opponents but as guardians against a threat to the world's balance.~
@51524 = ~Should Baldwin succeed in his quest, the ensuing havoc would respect no allegiances, affecting even those who believe they can control such forces.~
@51525 = ~Our actions, although they may seem obstructive, are measures taken to prevent a disaster of unfathomable proportions.~
@51526 = ~On our way to meet Nagate, we received a lucrative offer from another player in this shadowy game, one with a vested interest in seeing Baldwin and the Gorgon's Eye weakened.~
@51527 = ~This benefactor paid handsomely for a demonstration of force against Baldwin's stronghold.~
@51528 = ~Furthermore, it provided an opportunity to assess the defenses and capabilities of your paltry guild, gathering intelligence for future maneuvers.~
@51529 = ~It was a calculated risk, one that we deemed necessary given the complexity of the situation.~
@51530 = ~The world of shadows is often not as straightforward as it seems, and sometimes, actions that appear reckless have deeper, hidden motivations.~
@51531 = ~An amusing ploy, albeit an unsavory reflection of your loyalty, yet, it is one that I cannot satisfy. Your allegiance to Baldwin, whether unwavering or fractured, matters little now.~
@51532 = ~You stand before me as an obstacle, one that must be removed for the greater scheme to unfold.~
@51533 = ~Regrettably, this means your journey ends here, <CHARNAME>. It's time for you to embrace the fate that awaits all who meddle in affairs beyond their grasp.~
@51534 = ~These hallowed ruins, once a cradle of ancient wisdom, shall now serve as your tomb. It's a fitting end, perhaps, for one who dared to challenge the currents of power.~
@51535 = ~So, ready yourself, <CHARNAME>, for I must ensure that this storied ground becomes the final resting place of your ambitions.~
@51536 = ~So be it, if combat is your chosen path. But heed this warning before we clash.~
@51537 = ~Your allegiance to Baldwin and his quest for the Kerykeion is a path fraught with peril, more than you realize.~
@51538 = ~He seeks to reforge an artifact of devastating power, one that could unleash chaos untold upon Faerun. His obsession blinds him to the cataclysmic consequences.~
@51539 = ~Understand, your fight here may be against me, but the true battle, the one for the very fate of our world, lies ahead with the man you serve.~
@51540 = ~Now, if it is a fight you desire, I will grant it. But remember, the truths I speak may be the last you hear if you continue to follow Baldwin blindly.~
