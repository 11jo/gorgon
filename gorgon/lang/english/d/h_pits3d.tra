@51000 = ~You're not the first to seek the secrets of the pits, nor will you be the last. But remember, in these shadows, not everything is as it seems.~
@51001 = ~Curiosity often leads us to unexpected places, doesn't it? It takes more than strength to prevail, young shadow. The path to victory is rarely a straight one.~
@51002 = ~Lyria, what's your story? I'd like to learn more about you.~
@51003 = ~Any tips for a newcomer trying to make a mark in the pits?~
@51004 = ~Have you faced any memorable opponents in the arena?~
@51005 = ~I'll be going now.~
@51006 = ~Ah, you're looking to learn a bit about me, are you? Well, I suppose there's no harm in a tale or two.~
@51007 = ~I hail from Ravens Bluff, a city of shadows and secrets. Back in those days, I led a merry band of thieves, and we were quite the notorious lot.~
@51008 = ~But, as it often goes, things change. One day, I found myself in the midst of a colossal fighting tournament.~
@51009 = ~Imagine it, the clash of steel, the roar of the crowd, it was intoxicating. I fought my heart out, and though I didn't take the top spot, I secured a proud second place.~
@51010 = ~From that moment on, I knew my path was forever altered. The arena, the thrill of combat, it called to me like nothing ever had.~
@51011 = ~Now, I find myself here, in these pits, honing my skills and seeking to uncover every secret they hold.~
@51012 = ~So, my friend, that's a piece of Lyria Winterheart's tale. Care to share one of yours?~
@51013 = ~First and foremost, agility and quick thinking are your greatest allies. Don't rely solely on brute strength. A well-timed dodge or a swift strike can turn the tide in your favor.~
@51014 = ~Next, observe your opponents closely. Everyone's got a tell, a moment of vulnerability. It's your job to find it and exploit it.~
@51015 = ~And of course, never underestimate the power of surprise. Keep a trick or two up your sleeve. It's not about fighting fair, it's about surviving and thriving in the chaos of the arena.~
@51016 = ~Remember, every fighter has their own style. Adapt, learn, and never stop striving for improvement. That's the key to making a mark in these pits.~
@51017 = ~Aye, I've faced a few that left their mark. But the one I'll never forget was the previous reigning champion.~
@51018 = ~They called her Isla Darkcloak, and let me tell you, she was a force of nature, a living legend in these pits.~
@51019 = ~She fought with a strength and skill that was unmatched. It was a dance of death, watching her move. You could see the years of experience in every strike, every parry.~
@51020 = ~It was an honor crossing blades with her. She anticipated every move, every feint. It was like trying to catch smoke in your hands.~
@51021 = ~I'd learn more in one fight than I would have in a year of training.~
@51022 = ~When Isla retired, the pits lost a true icon. But she didn't fade into obscurity. Instead, she became one of the most sought-after mercenaries in the Sword Coast.~
@51023 = ~You'd be hard-pressed to find a noble who hasn't had dealings with her, whether they admit it or not.~
@51024 = ~If you ever cross paths with Isla, consider yourself warned. She's a force to be reckoned with, and there's no shame in walking away if you value your life.~
@51025 = ~Until next time, young shadow.~
@51026 = ~Sharp moves, and you kept your cool. Not bad at all. But remember, every victory comes with a lesson.~
@51027 = ~Quick on your feet, aren't you? Grom doesn't go down easily. Keep that agility up, and you might just go far in these pits.~
@51028 = ~That was a good fight, wasn't it? You've got potential. I could see you thinking on your feet. Keep learning, keep improving, and maybe one day you can become champion.~
@51029 = ~Your agility and speed definitely kept me on my toes. We'll fought, Lyria~
@51030 = ~I look forward to facing you again in the arena.~
@51031 = ~Well done! Serra is a tough nut to crack. You've proven yourself more than capable.~
@51032 = ~You did it! You took down Roran! That's no small feat, let me tell you. You're amazing! Keep honing those skills, and who knows what you might achieve.~
@51033 = ~I can't believe Isla's back in the pits, and for a deathmatch no less. She's a legend, you know. I've looked up to her for as long as I can remember. It's an honor to even share the arena with her.~
@51034 = ~As for you, well, you've certainly proven yourself, but facing Isla... That's a whole different league. Just be cautious and fight smart. She's got tricks up her sleeve that you've never seen before.~
@51035 = ~Death in the pits is a harsh reality, and you faced it head-on. Isla chose this path, as do we all when we step into this arena.~
@51036 = ~It's a testament to your strength, whether it sits heavy on your conscience or not.~
