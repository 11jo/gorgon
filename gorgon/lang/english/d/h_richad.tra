@56500 = ~<CHARNAME>! Set aside your quarrel with us. We must eliminate this abomination before it's too late!~
@56501 = ~If this creature should manage to escape, Faerun's fate will be sealed.~
@56502 = ~Come on, you men! Slay this atrocity before it consumes us all!~
@56503 = ~Our objectives are complete and there is no further dispute among us.~
@56504 = ~The piece Gerard held was a fake, a ruse, designed to deceive Baldwin.~
@56505 = ~The intention was for it to react fatally when combined with a genuine fragment. This... transformation, however, was unforeseen.~
@56506 = ~Nevertheless, Baldwin now lies defeated, and the Kerykeion has disintegrated beyond repair.~
@56507 = ~The final authentic fragment, however, has been kept in my possession, hidden for years.~
@56508 = ~My brother has soiled any significance it once held. I will offer it to you as a token of gratitude for your assistance, and as an effort to move past our shared history.~
@56509 = ~<CHARNAME>, your abilities have not gone unnoticed to those in our organization. Perhaps it would be beneficial for us to continue collaborating in some fashion.~
@56510 = ~Expect an envoy in the near future to discuss terms.~
@56511 = ~Good day.~
@56512 = ~Baldwin, enough! Take hold of your senses and cease this folly at once!~
@56513 = ~Ah, my dear brother, here to witness my ascent into godhood, are you? How considerate.~
@56514 = ~Godhood? Are you mad! I've come to stop you, and take ownership of the Kerykeion.~
@56515 = ~Surrender it, and I will bring you in before the Shadowmaster. There may still be mercy.~
@56516 = ~Do you take me a for a fool, brother? After all these years, the Kerykeion is finally within my grasp.~
@56517 = ~And here you stand, offering me your dungeons... when I could have the world, instead!~
@56518 = ~Do not let the pull of the Kerykeion consume you! Relieve yourself of its grasp, and we will somehow find a path back from this madness.~
@56519 = ~Ah, the voice of reason speaks! But it's far too late for that, the power is mine now, and with it, I shall have my retribution.~
@56520 = ~It was a dream we both shared once, do you remember? Or is even that lost to you now, along with your honor, after betraying your own brother!~
@56521 = ~I have not forgotten, yet, I cannot say the same for you.~
@56522 = ~It is you who are lost, brother. Ensnared in the malevolent embrace of the Kerykeion, and from it, you've emerged a dark taint of delusion.~
@56523 = ~You butcherd your kin. Cut them down like helpless dogs. There is no desire for retribution in your eyes, only malice.~
@56524 = ~You remain restrained by fear, lacking ambition, and that is why you will fail. You are still the same coward as you were on the day of my banishment.~
@56525 = ~Enough words, you utter and profound fool. I have stalled you long enough to complete my preperations for the fusion.~
@56526 = ~Now, watch, brother... as I become a god!~
@56527 = ~Dark sisters, I free you from your bonds! Grant me your eternal power!~
@56528 = ~AaaAAHHHH!!!~
