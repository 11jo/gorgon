@10000 = ~Oi, look what the cat dragged in. You've got the look of trouble 'bout you, or maybe it's just the night playin' tricks.~
@10001 = ~Ah, you're not one of the usual faces I see around here. The name's Ariosh, and I'm the eyes and ears on the streets.~
@10002 = ~I'm the one who sniffs out the marks with something worth takin'. Be it in the heart of the city or someone passin' through with pockets jinglin', I'm the man who knows.~
@10003 = ~Now, if you're ready to dip your fingers into the grit and grime of the underworld, to snatch what's ours from the unsuspecting, I might just have some work for ya.~
@10004 = ~Make no mistake, this ain't a venture for the faint-hearted or those clutchin' onto their precious notions of virtue.~
@10005 = ~We're talkin' about the kind of work that stains your hands, where the filth of the streets rubs off on you.~
@10006 = ~Of course, it ain't like it's for charity. You'll be well compensated for your efforts, assuming you're as capable as I've heard.~
@10007 = ~So, fancy yourself a sharp-eyed rogue? This could be the ticket. What's sayin', are you in?~
@10008 = ~Let's get to work.~
@10009 = ~This isn't my kind of venture, I'll pass.~
@10010 = ~Fair enough. No harm in knowing your limits. If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me.~
@10011 = ~Back for more, are ya? I've got a feeling you've had a change of heart. Ready to give it a go, or you still need some persuading?~
@10012 = ~Good choice, mate. You've just stepped into the real action. We'll make a fine team, mark my words.~
@10013 = ~Right. Listen up then, here's your first gig.~
@10014 = ~There's a pair of nobles passing through our town, loaded with coin and heading for the Nashkel Carnival. They're big spenders who are plannin' a little soiree outside the Jovial Juggler.~
@10015 = ~Your job? Simple. Figure out the best way to separate them from their wealth, and make it happen.~
@10016 = ~Employ your subtlety in gathering intel. It will be the linchpin to executing this mission with precision.~
@10017 = ~Be mindful, however, they've got a keen-eyed bloke keepin' watch. Don't be using the ol' cut-an'-run while he's on duty. You'll need to outsmart and outmaneuver him for this job.~
@10018 = ~Best not be makin' a mess on this venture, neither. These bigwigs have connections, and they'll be sendin' an army down if we start droppin' bodies. Got it?~
@10019 = ~No mess, no complications. I'll keep it clean and quiet.~
@10020 = ~No bloodshed, and no stealing while the guard's watching.~
@10021 = ~Right. Assimilate and gather information, then make your move to claim each one of the nobles purses.~
@10022 = ~They won't be kickin' off 'til the moon has her hold, so bide your time and strike when the night's embrace offers cover.~
@10023 = ~Back from the streets, are ya? Did your wits and skills serve you well in the pursuit of our prize?~
@10024 = ~I only managed to swipe one purse.~
@10025 = ~Got both purses right here.~
@10026 = ~Seems I've returned emptyhanded. The bouncer caught wind of me, mid-pick, and called off the party.~
@10027 = ~I'll be heading down shortly.~
@10028 = ~Alright, you've got one purse. It's a start, but we aim for precision in this game. Keep your wits sharp, keep practicing, and next time, we'll clean 'em out proper. Here's your share for what you've earned.~
@10029 = ~Hah! That's the spirit! You've got the touch, my friend. Those nobles won't know what hit 'em. Here's your cut of the loot, enjoy it and keep up the good work.~
@10030 = ~Blast it all! This ain't no nursery rhyme, <CHARNAME>. We're thieves, not clowns! You've got to up your game, or we'll be left with naught but pockets full of air.~
@10031 = ~Next time, get out there and do it right, be slicker, and make sure you come back with somethin' worthwhile.~
@10032 = ~Ah, you've got that look about you, like you're itching for more action, eh? Well, it just so happens I've got another job that might stir your blood.~
@10033 = ~We've got some freelancing rogues stirrin' up trouble in our turf, see? They're a nuisance we can't afford.~
@10034 = ~I need someone to teach 'em a lesson, but not just any lesson. We're gonna play a little game, you and me.~
@10035 = ~You're gonna be the bait, lure 'em out, and then... well, let's just say you'll teach them the price of crossing us.~
@10036 = ~Is there any more intel for me? Names, or how many we're dealing with?~
@10037 = ~Want me to gut 'em or just give a proper fright?~
@10038 = ~I'll deal with 'em proper. Just point me in the right direction.~
@10039 = ~I have some other things I need to do first.~
@10040 = ~The leader goes by Blackthorn. Real thorn in my arse if ya ask me. He's got a small crew, just a few men with him, nothing substantial.~
@10041 = ~Want me to gut 'em or just give 'em a right scare?~
@10042 = ~I'll trust your judgment. Just make certain they grasp the severity of the matter. If a proper scare won't suffice, consider offering a more... permanent solution.~
@10043 = ~Head to the north part of town, by the gardens. Wait until after sunset, and they'll be sure to strike.~
@10044 = ~Swiftly, head to the northern gardens. That's where Blackthorn and his crew will strike, after the sun dips below the horizon.~
@10045 = ~Back from navigatin' the shadowy byways, are ya?  Let's have it then, how'd it play out with the mark?~
@10046 = ~ The streets have swallowed 'em whole. They won't be causin' no more trouble for anyone.~
@10047 = ~I convinced 'em to find new ground. They wont be coming back.~
@10048 = ~Got 'em on board. They'll be workin' with us from now on. Expanding our reach, just like you wanted.~
@10049 = ~You've shown 'em the cold, hard truth of the streets, mate. Sometimes, it's the only language they understand.~
@10050 = ~The Gorgon's Eye's got your back, always remember that. Loyalty like yours is gold in these alleys.~
@10051 = ~Sharp work, that. No need for unnecessary blood spillin'. You've got a way with words, a way that makes 'em see the light.~
@10052 = ~The streets will remember this, and our foes won't forget your finesse. You're makin' quite the name for yourself, I'll tell ya.~
@10053 = ~If I didn't see it with me own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. You've got a way about ya, mate.~
@10054 = ~Bringin' others into the fold, expandin' our grip on these cobbled streets. That's how the Gorgon's Eye grows, that's how it thrives.~
@10055 = ~It's a feat not many could pull off. You're makin' history on these streets, you are. Well done, mate.~
@10056 = ~Right, next bit of business for ya, then. Got a job lined up that needs a swift step and a dance in the shadows.~
@10057 = ~We've got some choice goods stashed away in various drop points across the city. You'll need to move like a shadow and retrieve them without catching the eye of the City Watch.~
@10058 = ~Before you make your move, take a stroll, get the lay of the land, and see where them City Watch dogs are prowling.~
@10059 = ~You'll want to be as sly as a fox, slippin' past 'em without 'em even sniffin' you out. Once you've got their routines down, that's when you make your move. Smooth as silk, understand?~
@10060 = ~What kind of loot are we looking at?~
@10061 = ~If things take a turn, how should I handle the City Watch?~
@10062 = ~Got it. Where can I find the drop points?~
@10063 = ~Each of these spots holds a black sack, tied up nice and tight, containing a trove of illicit goods.~
@10064 = ~You'll find a mix of stolen valuables, artifacts, and contraband that will fetch quite a sum on the black market.~
@10065 = ~It's a good haul, no doubt about it. But remember, these goods ain't just valuable, they're symbols of our prowess. Treat 'em with care, and they'll repay you in kind.~
@10066 = ~If you find yourself in their sights, keep your wits about you.~
@10067 = ~A silver tongue might just charm 'em long enough for you to slip away. Quick feet, of course, are your best bet. Dodging 'round corners, vanishin' into the night.~
@10068 = ~Should push come to shove, don't hesitate to defend yourself. Better to come out on top than find yourself in their cells.~
@10069 = ~The stash spots are spread across the city, tucked away in nooks and crannies only the slyest can find.~
@10070 = ~One crate, nestled near the southern fountain, holds our first prize.~
@10071 = ~Watch for the play of moonlight on the water, it'll guide your way. And remember, patience is key. Let the city's rhythm be your ally.~
@10072 = ~Hidden beneath the northern gardens, you'll find a barrel with its secrets.~
@10073 = ~The shadows there are deep, and the air is thick with the scent of night-blooming flowers. Keep your senses sharp, and you'll be on your way in no time.~
@10074 = ~By the Smithy, there's a sack with our prize, waiting for its rightful owner.~
@10075 = ~The clink of hammer on anvil will be your backdrop. Watch for the Smithy's apprentice, he's an early riser. A quick hand will serve you well.~
@10076 = ~Just remember, our reputation rests on your shoulders. Make us proud, and get back here in one piece.~
@10077 = ~The night's young, and those coffers ain't gonna collect themselves. Get back out there and finish the job.~
@10078 = ~Back in one piece, I see. How'd the mission go? Any trouble slippin' past those City Watch dogs?~
@10079 = ~The goods are retrieved, but I had to silence a guard. No other choice.~
@10080 = ~It got messy out there. Had to send a few of 'em to the other side. But I got the job done.~
@10081 = ~A little smooth talking did the trick. The City Watch never knew what hit 'em.~
@10082 = ~The mission went smoothly, flew past 'em like a shadow.~
@10083 = ~Had to draw blood, did ya? It's a dangerous path we tread, but sometimes it can't be helped.~
@10084 = ~Just be wary of the repercussions. Word of a fallen guard spreads fast. Come morning, the town might be buzzing with talk. Here's your take. Good work.~
@10085 = ~Multiple guards, eh? That's a heavier toll. We can't afford to make too much noise. The City Watch won't take kindly to a spree like that.~
@10086 = ~Keep your wits about you, we don't want the whole town on our backs. Come dawn, there'll be no end to the chatter about this. Here's your take. Good work.~
@10087 = ~Talked your way out of it, did you? Quick thinking, that's what I like to hear. But don't get too complacent.~
@10088 = ~The City Watch ain't known for their forgetfulness. Come sunrise, there might be more eyes on us. Here's your take. Good work.~
@10089 = ~Gliding through the dark streets like a whispering breeze, leaving no trace of your passage. That's the mark of a true rogue.~
@10090 = ~Remember, in this line of work, the shadows are your closest confidants, and the night is your canvas. Here's your take. Good work.~
@10091 = ~Alright, lean in close. This one's got more twists than a coil of serpents. We've got a snake in our midst, slipping secrets to the City Watch.~
@10092 = ~This ain't a matter to take lightly. If we don't cut the head off this viper soon, it could mean curtains for all of us.~
@10093 = ~Now, here's where things get interesting. We've got our own bloke in the Watch, ears to the ground.~
@10094 = ~Word has it they've been utilizing a secret drop behind the Burning Wizard to exchange more than just pleasantries, if you catch my drift.~
@10095 = ~Our man in the Watch penned up an official note, one that invites the turncoat to a rendezvous at the southern fountains. Only, it ain't the Watch who'll be showing up.~
@10096 = ~Instead, it's gonna be you, blades drawn and ready for a little chat. I want this dealt with, and no half-measures.~
@10097 = ~So, we've got an inside man? Alright, what's the play?~
@10098 = ~A traitor among us. Let's smoke them out before they do more damage.~
@10099 = ~Your first move is dropping off that note in broad daylight when the town's alive and bustling. It'll be your ticket to blend in, making you seem like just another face in the crowd.~
@10100 = ~Then, when the night blankets the town, head to the fountain. Stay sharp, and keep your guard up. This is where the traitor's tale reaches its final chapter.~
@10101 = ~Remember, <CHARNAME>, this mission is bound to get messy. Keep your wits about you, and don't hesitate to get your hands dirty.~
@10102 = ~Aye, you're back, and I can see it in your eyes, <CHARNAME>. You've done what needed to be done.~
@10103 = ~Valera's coin has been spent. The city won't hear her whispers again.~
@10104 = ~Valera, bless her thieving heart. She had a nose for a glint of gold, that one. I'll pour one out for her, aye, a proper rogue she was.~
@10105 = ~Nothin' left for her now but shadows and echoes. She danced with the devil, mate. Playin' both sides of the coin, and there's only one way that tale ends.~
@10106 = ~Loose ends... they're dangerous, yeah? Can't have secrets whisperin' in the wrong ears, not in this game.~
@10107 = ~It's a dark path, but it's the only path that keeps us all breathin'. Remember that, <CHARNAME>. Remember what it means to walk these streets.~
@10108 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, the streets have grown quiet of late, but fret not. Patience is a blade in its own right, and in due time, opportunities will sprout like weeds in the cracks.~
@10109 = ~Keep those ears to the ground, and before you know it, we'll have our hands full with mischief aplenty.~
@10110 = ~Alright, mate. I've got the low-down on some stirrings within the City Watch. But first, we've got some business to attend to.~
@10111 = ~It's time to make our rounds and collect what's rightfully ours from the local establishments.~
@10112 = ~Four inns and taverns in this fine town, each owing their safety to us. We make sure they stay open, and they pay us in return.~
@10113 = ~It's the way of things, you see. These places thrive under our watchful eye, and it's high time they showed us their gratitude.~
@10114 = ~Now, go forth, and ensure our coffers are well-lined. Report back when you've secured our dues.~
@10115 = ~How much coin should I be collecting from each business?~
@10116 = ~What happens if they refuse to pay?~
@10117 = ~Is there any specific place I should start with?~
@10118 = ~Alright, I'll come back with the payments.~
@10119 = ~I'm not interested in this kind of work right now.~
@10120 = ~A proper sack from each lad. You'll know it's all accounted for when you lay eyes on it, nothin' to fuss about.~
@10121 = ~Refusal isn't an option, <CHARNAME>. If necessary, be ready to to use a sharp tongue, or an even sharper blade. We can't afford any shirkers.~
@10122 = ~Doesn't make a lick of difference, mate. Just make sure to hit 'em all, Feldepost's, the Juggler, Burnin' Wizard, and the Red Sheaf.~
@10123 = ~Good. Make sure you do, and make sure it's all there. We'll be watching, and those blokes better know what's good for 'em.~
@10124 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, how's the coin flowin' in? Any trouble with them tavern-keepers?~
@10125 = ~Only the Red Sheaf couldn't pay. I thought it best to give them a warning instead of resorting to... drastic measures.~
@10126 = ~Only the Red Sheaf couldn't pay. I chose to make an example out of him. He won't be causing any more trouble.~
@10127 = ~Still makin' the rounds. Be back in a jiffy.~
@10128 = ~A warning, eh? Sometimes, a lesson needs to be carved in blood for it to stick.~
@10129 = ~I'll have a couple of the lads pay our friend another visit. He'll learn soon enough what happens when he crosses the Gorgon's Eye.~
@10130 = ~Good work, <CHARNAME>. You've got a strong hand. No room for weakness in this business. The Red Sheaf will remember this lesson.~
@10131 = ~This is how we keep the wheels turning in Beregost. Every coin collected strengthens our grip, ensures our safety, and keeps the Gorgon's Eye thriving. Keep it up.~
@10132 = ~Listen close, <CHARNAME>, word's reached me from our mole in the Watch. They say we've got ourselves a proper high-hat Inspector who's crawled his way down from the Gate.~
@10133 = ~This bloke's no pushover. Nah, he's got a sharp wit, and he ain't afraid to use it. Takes his job seriously, he does. Flaming Fist through and through.~
@10134 = ~Except, he don't play by the usual rules, and he's none too happy 'bout the state of things 'ere. Rampant thievin', he says, and our little 'gang' gets the blame.~
@10135 = ~Here's where you come in, mate. We need this Inspector gone, sharpish. No room for niceties, no room for second-guessin'. Just sharp steel and a quick exit.~
@10136 = ~You make it look like the Watch's got itself a leaky roof, and we get to breathe easy.~
@10137 = ~What's so dangerous about this guy?~
@10138 = ~Consider it done. Where can I find this Inspector?~
@10139 = ~He's got a knack for reading between the lines, see? Knows how to play the game better than most of those Flaming Fist types.~
@10140 = ~He's not just a musclehead, but a thinker. A master of craft and guile, not brawn and badges.~
@10141 = ~This Inspector's got a reputation for getting things done, no matter the cost. And he's got a particular taste for rooting out trouble.~
@10142 = ~If he's sniffing around, you can bet he's after something big. We've got to be extra careful with this one, mate. He's a different breed entirely.~
@10143 = ~Aye, so she did. Valera had her ear to the ground after all. Guess she was spouting the truth.~
@10144 = ~Ah, now that's the tricky bit. Our mole in the Watch has given us a bit of a lead. The Inspector is holding a meeting tonight in Beregost's eastside.~
@10145 = ~They're trying to coordinate efforts to deal with the likes of us. It's your job to make sure they don't get too cozy with the locals, if you catch my drift.~
@10146 = ~You'll need to be a shadow, <CHARNAME>. Slip into that meeting like a ghost. And when the moment's ripe, snuff him out. Make it swift, and leave no trace behind.~
@10147 = ~Make it clean and make it count. You've got one chance at this, don't squander it.~
@10148 = ~The Inspector ran a clever game on us. The meeting was a ploy to smoke out our mole, and it worked.~
@10149 = ~I'll take him out, don't you worry.~
@10150 = ~That Inspector's got more tricks up his sleeve than I gave him credit for. Damn it! We need to regroup and plan our next move.~
@10151 = ~He'll get our man, the poor bastard, and he's gonna be in for a world of pain. I don't doubt his loyalty, but the Inspector won't hold back, and I dread to think what he'll do to get his answers.~
@10152 = ~He's surely no ordinary copper. He's sharp, and he's got a plan. We must be ready, <CHARNAME>. This game just got deadlier, and we can't afford any missteps.~
@10153 = ~We'll need to be one step ahead if we're going to make it out of this mess.~
@10154 = ~Aye, it seems we've underestimated this Inspector. We need to get inside his head, find his weaknesses, and turn the tables in our favor.~
@10155 = ~We need to take this fight to the heart of his throne, Baldur's Gate, where there's no better contact for gatherin' intel than Black Lily.~
@10156 = ~She's a shrewd operator, knows the ins and outs of the city better than anyone. I've known her for some time, and I'll admit, there's a certain admiration there.~
@10157 = ~Clever, resourceful, and as sharp as a stiletto. Mind yourself with her, she's got a knack for sussing out any hidden agenda.~
@10158 = ~Head to Baldur's Gate, find Black Lily, and see what she knows about this Inspector. Bring back whatever you find, and we'll use it to cut this snake down to size.~
@10159 = ~You'll be findin' Black Lily at the Baldur's Gate thieves guild. Remember, we may dance on different streets, but we ain't at each other's throats. You'll be stepping onto neutral ground.~
@10160 = ~This Inspector, he's been a thorn in our side for far too long, and when you were up at the Gate, he hit us hard.~
@10161 = ~Swept our drop spots, nabbed a dozen of our blokes, and even sent a few of 'em to meet the Reaper. He needs to pay, and we need to make sure of it.~
@10162 = ~So, listen close, mate. In case this plan don't dance the way we'd like, I've got an insurance policy for ya.~
@10163 = ~This 'ere's an incendiary device, specially made to set things ablaze quick as a flash. I want ya to tuck it away in the Jovial Juggler's kitchen, amidst all them liquor barrels and cookin' oils.~
@10164 = ~Then, you let the bartender know that unless he follows your lead, that place'll be reduced to cinders.~
@10165 = ~And if that Inspector tries to pull a fast one, don't hesitate to light the fuse and give him a fiery send-off.~
@10166 = ~But remember, it's a last resort, understand? If things can be resolved without the extra fuss, then by all means, we'll take that route.~
@10167 = ~What's the range on this thing? How far do I need to be before I set it off?~
@10168 = ~What's the likelihood of collateral damage with this plan?~
@10169 = ~Understood, Ariosh. I'm prepared for whatever comes our way.~
@10170 = ~Aye, you'll need to be within a reasonable distance to set it off. Any spot on the ground level should work. But don't worry, I've got a potion that'll offer you some protection from the flames.~
@10171 = ~It won't make you fireproof, mind you, but it'll help keep you from being scorched too badly.~
@10172 = ~Collateral damage will be high, no doubt about it. Anyone in the vicinity when that thing goes off is likely to meet a fiery end.~
@10173 = ~That includes the Inspector, but it also means anyone else in the way. It's a last resort, lad. We're not taking this lightly.~
@10174 = ~Good. Remember, we're counting on you. Don't let us down, mate.~
@10175 = ~Set that device up in the kitchen, yeah? And try to be sneaky about it. Force the barkeep to play his part, sit back, and watch the final of act of the Inspector's play.~
@10176 = ~Word's already gettin' 'round about something big going down at the Juggler. Let's get a formal report, yeah?~
@10177 = ~The plan was smooth sailing. Ishani played it off well and the Inspector went down without a fuss.~
@10178 = ~The Inspector saw through the ruse, forcing my hand to take action.~
@10179 = ~I didn't want to risk the plan failing, so I took matters into my own hands.~
@10180 = ~Had no choice but to blow the joint. The Inspector was burned alive.~
@10181 = ~Ishani's charms and that tainted chalice did the trick, eh? Well played.~
@10182 = ~A twist in the plot, it seems. The Inspector wasn't an easy mark, and he smelt a rat. Your intervention was the only way to secure our hides, well done.~
@10183 = ~Alright, mate. You didn't stick to the original script, but you got the job done, and that's what matters.~
@10184 = ~Damn it, things got messier than I'd have liked. It was a tough call, no doubt about it. But you did what you had to do to get the job done.~
@10185 = ~The Inspector's out of the picture, and the Watch, who thought they had us cornered, are starting to question where their loyalties lie.~
@10186 = ~Word's spreading about our mettle, and the whispers of dissent are growing louder. Soon, it'll just be Commander Whitewood left standing, and the Gorgon's Eye will rise.~
@10187 = ~<CHARNAME>, we are on the cusp of victory. Whitewood is the last hurdle standing between us and absolute control of Beregost. But she's not standing alone.~
@10188 = ~She commands her most ardent Valkyries, Clare and Theresa Gallant. A pair of dangerous and deadly sisters of divine heritage, forever steadfast in their sacred duty.~
@10189 = ~These lieutenants, they're the cogs keeping her contraption in motion, and we've got to yank 'em out.~
@10190 = ~Clare's a creature of habit, you see. Each dawn, like clockwork, she takes a stroll down the temple byway to the southeast. A soft spot for nature, that one.~
@10191 = ~It's our bit of good fortune that this locale's a bit off the beaten path, away from prying eyes. No witnesses, no curious onlookers. It's the perfect moment to make our move.~
@10192 = ~Now, Theresa, she's a different sort altogether. She's as battle-hardened as they come, wears her scars like a badge of honor.~
@10193 = ~She's not one to frequent the finer establishments. No, she prefers the after hours rough-and-tumble of the Burning Wizard.~
@10194 = ~You'll find her there, more often than not, nursin' a tankard of ale, or sharin' a bed with whatever 'lucky' bloke catches her eye.~
@10195 = ~Listen up, mate. This ain't a game of brawn, it's a dance of finesse. Timing is key, and you'll need to be as quiet as a whisper in a silent room. We don't want a whiff of our scent near 'em.~
@10196 = ~Slide through the shadows, stay low, and make sure they never even catch a glimpse of you. When you're close, strike fast, one lethal blow from behind, swift as a serpent's bite.~
@10197 = ~This is true assassination work, reserved for the masters of stealth and precision. One strike, one life extinguished.~
@10198 = ~It's a dance, my friend, and you're about to lead.~
@10199 = ~Stealth, surprise, that's your ticket. They won't see you comin' if you play your cards right.~
@10200 = ~Aye, I've heard the whispers already. Word's spread like wildfire about those Valkyrie twins meetin' their untimely end. Good work, mate.~
@10201 = ~Sleeker than a shadow, they never knew what hit 'em.~
@10202 = ~Clare caught a glimpse, but it was too late for her.~
@10203 = ~Theresa had a moment, but it didn't save her.~
@10204 = ~They both looked me in the eye before the end.~
@10205 = ~You've got the touch, mate. Snuffing 'em out without leaving a trace. You're a true master of the craft, you are.~
@10206 = ~You managed to get the job done, but remember, true masters of stealth leave no room for doubt. Keep honing those skills.~
@10207 = ~Alright, listen up, <CHARNAME>. You've proven yourself today. With the twins out of the picture, Whitewood's grip on the City Watch will start slippin'.~
@10208 = ~Now, we'll need to make our move and secure our position. Gather the lads, we're going to have a little chat with the good Commander.~
@10209 = ~This is where the real game begins, and you've earned your place at the table. Remember, we're not just thieves anymore. We're the shadowy hand that guides Beregost. Let's make it count.~
@10210 = ~Remember, <CHARNAME>, this is our chance to tip the scales in our favor. Make it count. The fate of the Gorgon's Eye and the future of Beregost hang in the balance.~
@10211 = ~Well now, <CHARNAME>, that look of yours tells quite the tale. Did you cross paths with Commander Whitewood, or did she cross yours?~
@10212 = ~It was a heated dance, but in the end, her resolve crumbled. Beregost is primed for the taking.~
@10213 = ~She met her end, Ariosh. The Temple is a graveyard now, and the city will soon bend to our will.~
@10214 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, this is it. With Whitewood out of the picture, the title of Commander will pass to one of our own. The Gorgon's Eye's sway will echo across the realm.~
@10215 = ~This town will kneel, and Beregost will be ours. From this point on, we will dictate the destiny of this city, and our power shall only grow.~
@10216 = ~You're cut from the cloth of shadows, <CHARNAME>, a master thief, through and through.~
@10217 = ~You belong to the gritty underbelly now, the murky cobbled alleys, where deals are sealed with a blade and secrets are whispered in the dark.~
@10218 = ~Keep those ears sharp and your wits sharper, and there's no tellin' what heights you'll scale in these shadows. You were born for this life, you were.~
@10219 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, we've got the City Watch dancing to our tune now. We've got work ahead, and it won't be easy, but together, we'll leave our mark on this town.~
@10220 = ~Well, if it ain't the new Guildmaster. What's the plan then, eh? Just give the word, and I'm at your service.~
@10221 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>. We're on orders to await your signal. Ready to roll when you give the word.~
@10222 = ~Weapons secured, boys. Divy 'em up and prep for action.~
@10223 = ~Just reporting in before we kick off. Stay on your toes.~
@10224 = ~Err. What's the plan again?~
@10225 = ~Copy that. Alright you men. You heard the lass. Stand fast 'til she brings back the weapons.~
@10226 = ~Copy that. Alright you men. You heard the lad. Stand fast 'til he brings back the weapons.~
@10227 = ~Get in those tents and swipe the weapons off every gamesman inside. Get back here, quick as you can, and dish out them darts. We'll handle the rest.~
@10228 = ~Aye! Listen up you men! Grab your gear and move out! Let's teach these southern boys a right lesson about the Gorgon's Eye!~
@10229 = ~Baldwin! The Shadow Thieves have infiltrated the city! A dozen of their rank fight above us as we speak!~
@10230 = ~Scores remain outside Beregost with Thamuz at its helm! They will be here by daybreak!~
@10231 = ~So, they've finally decided to make their move, have they? Guildmates! Clear for action and steady yourselves for battle!~
@10232 = ~Rhade! Spread our supplies throughout the guild. Dispatch word to any cutthroats and sell-swords looking for a payday.~
@10233 = ~Ariosh! I need those eyes of yours in the field. Scout the vanguard's movements, mark their numbers, and track their lieutenants.~
@10234 = ~Find their weakest link and report back before dawn.~
@10235 = ~Aye!~
@10236 = ~Liedel! Activate the traps at the city's edge. Get them ready, every snare, every tripwire, ensure they're set to strike with deadly precision.~
@10237 = ~Rigaldo! Recall our numbers back from duty and get them blades for the grindstone. We need every edge razor-sharp and ready to slice through shadow and flesh.~
@10238 = ~Sir!~
@10239 = ~<CHARNAME>, our immediate priority is to cleanse the city of these rats while we prepare for the incoming siege.~
@10240 = ~Grab your guild armaments from Rhade and then embark on your mission. Report back when the city is purged of these treacherous vermin, and be swift!~
