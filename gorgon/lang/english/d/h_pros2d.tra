@53000 = ~Well, hello there, darling. What can a person like me do for someone as enchanting as you?~
@53001 = ~Listen closely, and listen well. It would be in your best interest to ensure that guard's attention is elsewhere. You'd be wise to oblige.~
@53002 = ~You know, I overheard the guard saying he's quite taken with you. He'd be thrilled if you were to engage him for a while, give him a break from his duties.~
@53003 = ~You see, there's a small wager going on, and the guard's involved. If you could manage to draw his attention elsewhere, it could tip the odds in our favor.~
@53004 = ~I won't be coerced into this. My talents are for the guests, and that's where they'll stay.~
@53005 = ~My arrangement here is to fraternize with the patrons, not the guards. It's best if we stick to the original plan, I think.~
@53006 = ~Oh, you are a clever one, aren't you? A little game of chance, I do enjoy a bit of excitement. Very well, let's see what I can do.~
@53007 = ~Well, they say a dance is just a vertical expression of a horizontal desire.~
@53008 = ~Oh, you're quite the bold one, aren't you? I do hope you can keep up with my... pace.~
@53009 = ~Ah, the night is young, and so are we. Let's make the most of it, shall we?~
@53010 = ~You have a certain fire in your eyes. I wonder what other passions lie beneath the surface?~
@53011 = ~You're a mystery, my dear. I wonder what secrets you hold, waiting to be discovered.~
@53012 = ~They say that true connection happens in the spaces between words. Care to find out?~
@53013 = ~A night like this calls for bold moves and daring hearts, wouldn't you agree?~
@53014 = ~There's a certain electricity between us, don't you think?~
@53015 = ~Oh, yoohoo! Guard!~
@53016 = ~Huh? Yes, what is it?~
@53017 = ~A man of duty, so admirable. I must admit, there's something rather alluring about a guard in uniform.~
@53018 = ~Oh, uh, well, thank you, ma'am. It's just part of the job, you know.~
@53019 = ~Part of the job, perhaps. But it does add a certain... appeal. You carry yourself with such confidence.~
@53020 = ~I, uh, try my best. It's important to maintain a presence, I suppose.~
@53021 = ~Presence indeed. And may I say, you have a rather intriguing aura about you. It's not every day one encounters a man with such magnetism.~
@53022 = ~You know, I'd love to hear more about your... duties. Why don't you come over and keep me company for a while?~
