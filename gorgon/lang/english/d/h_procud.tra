@52500 = ~Aye, you must be <CHARNAME>. You've got some reputation in the guild, I'll give ya that. Welcome to Nashkel.~
@52501 = ~The name's Procus. I'll be overseein' matters here in Nashkel for the expansion of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@52502 = ~Now, you might be wonderin' why we've set our sights on this little hamlet. Well, you see, Nashkel's a quiet sort of place, nestled on the edge of Amn. But it's got potential, it does.~
@52503 = ~A carnival, a bustling trade route, and a distinct lack of those meddling Flaming Fist types. This is where we make our move, and expand our reach.~
@52504 = ~Now, peak that tent just a stone's throw away. Our future base of operations, ripe for the taking. However, there's a certain merchant in there who's proving rather... resistant to our advances.~
@52505 = ~You've got options. Smooth-talk him out, give him a little scare, or if you're feeling bold, well... you know what to do.~
@52506 = ~Once that's sorted, we'll have a proper foothold in this place. Now then, any questions before you set off?~
@52507 = ~What's the overall plan for expanding our influence here in Nashkel?~
@52508 = ~What's the current situation with the Shadow Thieves in this area? Should we be concerned about them?~
@52509 = ~Can you provide any additional information about Nashkel, its locals, or the carnival?~
@52510 = ~I'll get to work on securing that base.~
@52511 = ~Well, the plan is to establish a firm foothold in this strategic location. Nashkel sits at a crossroads of trade routes and is known for its valuable gem mines.~
@52512 = ~Our aim is to capitalize on these resources and establish a network of operations.~
@52513 = ~We'll be targeting key figures, manipulating local markets, and ensuring our presence goes unnoticed by those who might meddle in our affairs.~
@52514 = ~The end goal is to make Nashkel a profitable hub for our endeavors.~
@52515 = ~The Shadow Thieves have their claws deep in Athkatla, but up here in Nashkel, they're less of a concern.~
@52516 = ~This town, on the outskirts of Amn and separated by the Cloud Peaks, is not their primary stomping ground. However, we must remain vigilant.~
@52517 = ~Their reach can be long, and it wouldn't surprise me if they took an interest in our activities.~
@52518 = ~Either way, we will operate under the assumption that they are aware of our presence. It's best to prepare for any eventuality.~
@52519 = ~Nashkel is a quiet mining town known for its rich gem deposits. The locals tend to keep to themselves, focused on their work.~
@52520 = ~The carnival, on the other hand, is a curious affair. It draws in folks from all around, creating a perfect cover for our operations.~
@52521 = ~Keep an eye out for interesting characters. You never know who might be a useful ally... or a potential target. Just remember to blend in, and don't draw undue attention to yourself.~
@52522 = ~Good. Remember, a swift and quiet operation is what we aim for. Get that tent under our control, and we'll have a solid foundation to build on. Go on now, make your mark.~
@52523 = ~It's this tent, you see, the one with the armor merchant plying his wares inside.~
@52524 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I see you've returned. What news do you bring from the carnival? Has our plan to secure the tent come to fruition?~
@52525 = ~The deed is done, Procus. The tent is ours now, clear and ready for our operations.~
@52526 = ~Excellent work. You've proven yourself a capable asset to our cause. Now, let's ensure everything is in order.~
@52527 = ~Meet me in the tent, and we'll discuss the next steps. There's much to be done, and your skills will be invaluable in the days ahead.~
@52528 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, this here's a proper spot for us, it is. A sweet bit of real estate. Plenty of eyes on it, but none the wiser about our doings, see?~
@52529 = ~Take a gander around. We've established ourselves quite nicely, I reckon.~
@52530 = ~There's a keen-eyed lad stationed at the door, in case any unwanted guests get curious. And see that one over there? A right skilled fence, ready to help us peddle our goods.~
@52531 = ~Now, as for our next bit of business, there's some lads about the area, freelancin' their way through life. Good with their hands, but lackin' direction, if you catch my drift.~
@52532 = ~Footpads, we call 'em. Petty crimes, bit of this, bit of that. They're ripe for the takin', they just don't know it yet.~
@52533 = ~We need 'em, <CHARNAME>. Could be right handy in expandin' our reach. You'll need to find 'em, talk their language, and let 'em see the light, so to speak.~
@52534 = ~The leader of the crew answers to the name Selena Stardancer, a clever one she is. Remember that, might come in handy.~
@52535 = ~What should I do if negotiations turn sideways?~
@52536 = ~Anything else you can tell me about Selena?~
@52537 = ~Consider it done. Where can I find Selena and her crew?~
@52538 = ~If it comes to that, and they won't see reason, well... take whatever measures necessary to ensure they won't be a problem for us in the future.~
@52539 = ~Selena Stardancer, a name that carries quite the weight in certain circles. She hails from the Pirate Isles, a place known for producing the finest swashbucklers.~
@52540 = ~Legend has it, she once single-handedly outsmarted a whole fleet of naval vessels sent by a rival pirate lord.~
@52541 = ~With a clever ruse and a touch of daring, she lured them into treacherous waters, causing a spectacular chain reaction of collisions and chaos.~
@52542 = ~It was said to be a sight to behold, leaving her reputation firmly etched in the annals of maritime infamy.~
@52543 = ~Selena's a cunning one, <CHARNAME>, with a wit as sharp as her blade. She knows how to handle herself in any situation, and she's got an uncanny knack for sniffing out profitable opportunities.~
@52544 = ~Earning her respect won't be easy, but once you do, we'll have one of the shrewdest rogues in the realms on our side.~
@52545 = ~From what I gather, they're partial to loitering behind the lotus tents. That's where you're likely to catch them in their element.~
@52546 = ~Off you go, then. Find our potential recruits, and let 'em know we've got a proper venture for folks like them.~
@52547 = ~Remember, persuasion's the key. Show 'em the path to a more profitable venture. If all else fails, trust your instincts. They've led you this far, after all.~
@52548 = ~You've made an impact, <CHARNAME>. With Selena and her crew on our side, we're set to thrive here, all while keeping under the radar. No grandiose attention, just the slow and steady acquisition of power.~
@52549 = ~Seems like talkin' didn't do the trick, eh? A shame, really. Would've been a tidy partnership.~
@52550 = ~But hey, with them out of the picture, we'll have a bit more breathing room in these parts. Could work in our favor, in the end.~
@52551 = ~You've made an impact, <CHARNAME>. With Selena and her crew no longer a threat, we're set to thrive here, all while keeping under the radar. No grandiose attention, just the slow and steady acquisition of power.~
@52552 = ~But every venture needs a bit of gold to grease the wheels, you know, and I've got a few marks in mind. All ripe for the taking.~
@52553 = ~There is an alchemist here, a potion merchant, setup in one of the tents. He's been reaping hefty profits from the carnival's visitors.~
@52554 = ~He's become a bit careless with his earnings, leaving a substantial sum of gold in a locked chest within his tent.~
@52555 = ~Next on the list is the large manor in the heart of Nashkel. Word is, their youngest daughter's been squirreling away coins for an elopement.~
@52556 = ~Find her room on the second floor, past a hall adorned with chandeliers. The stash is waiting for ya, within an ornate chest.~
@52557 = ~Lastly, the Nashkel Inn. It's known for its discreet ambiance, perfect for our endeavors.~
@52558 = ~Access the bartender's quarters through a concealed door at the back. The coins are hidden in a false bottom of a wine crate.~
@52559 = ~Stealth and shadows, <CHARNAME>, you know the drill.~
@52560 = ~These marks won't know what hit 'em.~
@52561 = ~Got it. I'll return when I've secured the loot.~
@52562 = ~Keep a low profile, and return here when you've got the spoils. We're relying on your expertise, my friend.~
@52563 = ~Impressive haul, those bags. You've got a knack for this, no doubt.~
@52564 = ~This gold, it ain't just shiny coins, you know, it's the foundation of our little empire.~
@52565 = ~We've got a solid base of operations now, a crew that can hold its own, and a tidy sum of gold to kick things off. Thanks to your efforts, we're poised for success.~
@52566 = ~Rigaldo will be itchin' to hear about our success, so make your way back and give him the news. We're on the edge of something big, my friend.~
@52567 = ~Things are going steady down here. The crew is settling in, and our operations are gaining traction. We're making strides in Nashkel, thanks to your efforts.~
