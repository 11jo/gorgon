@57000 = ~My own men... my own trusted comrades, turned on me, betrayed me.~
@57001 = ~Their blood stains my hands because of you, because of your vile machinations. You orchestrated this chaos. You turned the City Watch against me, against everything I've stood for.~
@57002 = ~You... you wretched filth. Mark my words, <CHARNAME> of the Gorgon's Eye, I won't go down without a fight. I'll make sure your villainous guild crumbles, even if it costs me my life.~
@57003 = ~This temple, this town... they've been my charge, my duty. And I'll protect them with every ounce of my being!~
@57004 = ~Your reign ends here, Whitewood. You played your hand, and now it's time to pay the price. Beregost belongs to the Gorgon's Eye now.~

@57008 = ~No, it is you who have usurped their voices, weaving a dark tapestry of deceit and manipulation that puppeteers their actions. Their wills are but marionettes, dancing to the malevolent tune you compose.~
@57009 = ~Their souls cry out for justice, and I shall be their instrument of vengeance. The shadows you've cast over Beregost will be dispelled, and the light of righteousness shall prevail.~
@57010 = ~I swore an oath to protect this town, to shield it from the likes of you. Beregost deserves better than to fall to the darkness you represent.~
@57011 = ~My duty remains unwavering, and I will give my last breath to see it fulfilled.~
@57012 = ~You will die here. And when I'm through with you, I'll lead these knights into the heart of your den and wipe out every last one of your treacherous lot.~
@57013 = ~Draw you blade, <CHARNAME>. Let's settle this once and for all, and see whose resolve prevails.~
@57014 = ~My own men... my own trusted comrades, turned on me. Betrayed me.~
@57015 = ~You will die here. And when I'm through with you, I'll lead the Knights into the heart of your den and wipe out every last one of your treacherous lot.~
