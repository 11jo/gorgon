@67000 = ~My own men... my own trusted comrades, turned on me, betrayed me.~
@67001 = ~Their blood stains my hands because of you, because of your vile machinations. You orchestrated this chaos. You turned the City Watch against me, against everything I've stood for.~
@67002 = ~You... you wretched filth. Mark my words, <CHARNAME> of the Gorgon's Eye, I won't go down without a fight. I'll make sure your villainous guild crumbles, even if it costs me my life.~

@67010 = ~I swore an oath to protect this town, to shield it from the likes of you. Beregost deserves better than to fall to the darkness you represent.~
@67011 = ~My duty remains unwavering, and I will give my last breath to see it fulfilled.~
@67012 = ~You will die here. And when I'm through with you, I'll lead these knights into the heart of your den and wipe out every last one of your treacherous lot.~
@67013 = ~Draw you blade, <CHARNAME>. Let's settle this once and for all, and see whose resolve prevails.~
