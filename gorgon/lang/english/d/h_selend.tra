@58000 = ~Avast 'ere, ye scurvy dog! Wha's th' wind blowin' ye t' me an' me scallywags, struttin' ye about like ye own th' joint? Spit it out, why be ye here?~
@58001 = ~I represent the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild. We've heard of your reputation, Selena, and would like to discuss a potential partnership.~
@58002 = ~I'm here to ensure you and your crew don't become a problem for us in these parts. How we proceed forward is up to you.~
@58003 = ~This territory now belongs to me, and I've come to eliminate any contenders. Unsheathe your blades, pirate!~
@58004 = ~Well, well, see 'ere an' 'ave a gander at ye, all puffed up an' ready fer a scrap! This bit o' ground won't be swappin' 'er owners so easily, mark me words!~
@58005 = ~An' what, I be askin', d'ye mean by them words, eh? Ye think ye can stroll in 'ere an' give us the ol' heave-ho, do ye? Well, we'll see 'bout that now, won't we?~
@58006 = ~The Gorgon's Eye is lookin' to bolster its ranks with a crew of your caliber. Think of the spoils we could reap, and the exciting adventures to be had.~
@58007 = ~Let me be plain, Selena. Join up with the Gorgon's Eye, or prepare for a tempest of trouble.~
@58008 = ~Ye've got a tongue sharp'r than a cutlass, matey! I ain't takin' orders from ye. Draw yer steel, an' let's settle this th' ol'-fashioned way!~
@58009 = ~Gorgon's Eye, ye say? Ne'er 'eard o' the likes. Ain't no wind of 'em in me reckonin'. What've they got 'ere that we can't be findin' on our own, eh?~
@58010 = ~We'll open doors for untold wealth, boundless riches, and a plunderer's dream of spoils and fortunes. It's an opportunity like no other.~
@58011 = ~Embracing the Gorgon's Eye means embarking on a grand adventure, a life of daring escapades and legendary exploits.~
@58012 = ~We can tap into a vast reservoir of resources and connections that reach far and wide across the realms.~
@58013 = ~Aye, I'll admit, th' notion o' alignin' with a bigger outfit 'as its appeal. More resourcin', more reachin' clout 'cross th' seas, an' th' coastal crews.~
@58014 = ~But let's not be hoistin' anchor too quick, ya? I'll be needin' a sign, a testament t' yer capabilities an' dedication.~
@58015 = ~In th' heart o' Nashkel, within th' Amnian army's barracks, there's a set o' documents that would do wonders in clearin' me crew's name o' any unlawful misgivin's.~
@58016 = ~Bring those parchments t' me, an' ye'll find us sailin' alongside th' Gorgon's Eye flag. Keep in mind, though, this ain't a task fer those green in th' face or quick to th' sea-sick.~
@58017 = ~Th' barracks are guarded tighter than a clam's shell, an' th' prize we're seekin' could be under tighten' lock-up in th' army's coffers. Can ye 'andle such a feat, I wonder?~
@58018 = ~You've got a deal, Stardancer. I'll retrieve those papers, and in return, you and your crew will be joining our little operation here.~
@58019 = ~I've no intention of provoking the Amnian army. Your best course of action is to fall in line with our plans. Disobedience will come at a cost.~
@58020 = ~Aye, it'll be settled 'ere then. Ye secure them papers, and ye'll have a crew o' true rogues workin' alongside ye, no doubt about it.~
@58021 = ~Off wit' ye, then! Bring back 'ere them scribbles, an' we'll be standin' tall together, ready fer whatever be comin' our way, savvy?~
@58022 = ~Ah, ye've got that look about ye, like a cat that's got the cream. Let's see 'em then, ya? I'm fixin' to peek at these secrets they've been scribblin' down 'bout me an' me crew.~
@58023 = ~Here's the documents, as promised.~
@58024 = ~Ye've done good, ye have, mate! These papers'll keep th' army off our backs for a spell, that's fer sure.~
@58025 = ~I can't stand them stuffy soldiers pokin' their noses where they don't belong. They'll be scratchin' their heads for a while now!~
@58026 = ~I pledged me word to ye and, by the seas, I'll be stickin' to it. We'll meet ye back at yer headquarters, don't ye worry.~
@58027 = ~Oh, did ye think ye could sneak 'round these parts without us knowin'? We've got our ways, we do.~
@58028 = ~Aye, I reckon we'll fit in just fine 'round these waters. Plen'y o' opportunities, an' a crew like ours knows how t'make th' most o' 'em. It's excitin', it is!~
