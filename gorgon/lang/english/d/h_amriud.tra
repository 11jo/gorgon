@9500 = ~Scram, mate. Ain't in the mood for gabbin' with some random bloke. Me head's killin' me, and I'm not exactly chuffed to be chattin'.~
@9501 = ~So unless you've got a pint or somethin' for this ache, do one.~
@9502 = ~Rough night, huh? Looks like you've been through the wringer.~
@9503 = ~Seems you're having a bad day, and I've no interest in making it worse. Good luck with that.~
@9504 = ~Yeah, s'pose it's been a rough one. Had a bit of a run-in that didn't end too well for my face. Not lookin' for pity, though, So if you're just 'ere to have a laugh, you've seen it all.~
@9505 = ~Does it look like I'm laughing? I'm here about that hit you've slapped on Aisha.~
@9506 = ~Just here for some facts, Amrius. I want to talk about Aisha's bounty.~
@9507 = ~I'm not one to find joy in others' troubles. Now, what's the story with you and Aisha?~
@9508 = ~That bounty, eh? Unfortunate bit of business, that. But look at me mug, this wasn't just a bit of bad luck at the card table. She's got a temper on her, that one, and a right hook to match.~
@9509 = ~Can't just let that slide, now, can I? She needs to learn, you can't go around smacking people and not expect consequences.~
@9510 = ~And before you start, I know what you're thinking, but it's not just about the scrap. It's about respect, about teaching a lesson.~
@9511 = ~She thinks she can walk away from me, make a fool of me in front of everyone? Not on my watch. She deserves every bit of what's coming.~
@9512 = ~She says you got handsy and she had to fight back. Sounds like you brought this on yourself.~
@9513 = ~Aisha told me a different story, that you were drunk and wouldn't take no for an answer.~
@9514 = ~According to Aisha, you were the aggressor, and she was only acting in self defense.~
@9515 = ~No, no, no, you've got it all wrong. That ain't what happened at all. Look, I was chattin' up another bird that night, yeah? And Aisha, she gets all jealous, sees me talking and loses it.~
@9516 = ~I go over to smooth things over, and she just flips. Starts hittin', fightin', going completely mad.~
@9517 = ~She shoves me, and I'm telling you, I wasn't about to hit a woman, not in front of the whole tavern. So, I back off, but she pushes me right into that table.~
@9518 = ~I was drunk, yeah, and fuming. So, I put the bounty on her, right there and then. It wasn't about her saying 'no' or anything like that. It was her making a scene, making me look like a right git!~
@9519 = ~I'm not here to play judge. Your spat with Aisha is your business. I just want that bounty gone.~
@9520 = ~Honestly, I couldn't care less who started what. I'm just here to see that bounty on Aisha removed.~
@9521 = ~That's an interesting twist. I think I'll double-check this with Aisha. Two sides to every story, after all.~
@9522 = ~Your version is quite different. I'll have a word with Aisha about this. I want to make sure I'm getting the whole truth.~
@9523 = ~Why should I lift that hit, eh?~
@9524 = ~You've got no idea, mate. She's the one who stirred up this whole mess, not me.~
@9525 = ~There I was, mindin' my own, and she flies off the handle, makes a right scene in front of everyone. And let me tell you, it's not just that one time.~
@9526 = ~Aisha's got a screw loose, I swear. One minute she's sweet as honey, the next, she's a raging storm, throwing accusations, screaming blue murder. It's not normal, I tell ya.~
@9527 = ~It's like watching someone else take over her, or chatting with a brick wall that suddenly decides to swing at you. You can't predict her, and that's dangerous.~
@9528 = ~She needs a lesson in keeping her head, in understanding actions have consequences. Can't have someone that unpredictable roaming around causing havoc. It's bad for business, bad for everyone.~
@9529 = ~Fair enough, Amrius. I'll go back and have a word with Aisha. Let's see if her story holds up.~
@9530 = ~Listen, Amrius, I can make this real ugly for you, or you can lift the bounty and walk away. Your choice.~
@9531 = ~Think about it logically, Amrius. Keeping this bounty only escalates things. You could end up drawing unwanted attention to yourself.~
@9532 = ~Imagine if you were in Aisha's place, Amrius. Frightened, alone, with a price on your head. Wisdom is knowing when to forgive.~
@9533 = ~Come on, Amrius. You're a reasonable man, aren't you? Drop the bounty, and we can put all this behind us, no hard feelings.~
@9534 = ~Alright, alright, keep your shirt on. I'm not in shape for another brawl. You're a tough one, ain't ya? It's been a while since I've felt outmatched.~
@9535 = ~Look, I'm all for standing my ground, but maybe going after Aisha ain't the smartest move right now. Alright, I'll lift the bounty.~
@9536 = ~You think you can intimidate me? Ha! I've seen worse than you. The bounty stays.~
@9537 = ~You're making a lot of sense, more than I care to admit. I've been so fixated on getting back at Aisha, I didn't stop to think of the trouble it's stirrin' up.~
@9538 = ~I need to keep things low-key, and this bounty is like a beacon, ain't it? Alright, you've made your point. The hit's off. I don't need any more eyes on my business.~
@9539 = ~Trying to outsmart me? Nice try, but I'm not convinced. The bounty stays. Aisha needs to learn her lesson.~
@9540 = ~I've been so wrapped up in my own anger, I hadn't stopped to consider it from her angle. Yeah, I've been in tight spots before, felt the world against me. It ain't a good place to be.~
@9541 = ~Maybe I did let my anger get the best of me. Alright, I'll remove the bounty. But don't expect me to forgive and forget.~
@9542 = ~Empathy? For her? Not a chance. She made her bed, now she can lie in it. The bounty stays.~
@9543 = ~Well, when you put it like that... This whole thing with Aisha's been a right headache, and what's it really getting me? More aggro than it's worth.~
@9544 = ~Alright, you've got me. I'll lift the bounty. But don't think I'm always this easy to sway.~
@9545 = ~Sweet talk won't work on me. I'm not lifting that bounty for anything. Aisha's got to pay for what she did.~
@9546 = ~Right then, you've bent my ear enough, and I ain't too big to admit when I've maybe gone a bit overboard. But don't get it twisted, this ain't me going soft.~
@9547 = ~She's still in deep with me, and I won't be forgettin' her little stunt anytime soon. But for now, I've got bigger fish to fry than squabbling over some tavern scrap.~
@9548 = ~You've got some bottle, chattin' up to me like this. Not everyday someone manages to get through to Amrius. But don't think this makes us pals or nothin'.~
@9549 = ~Now jog on, I've got a right mess to sort, and it's all thanks to you stickin' your nose in.~
@9550 = ~So, save your gab, mate. I've been round the block, seen all sorts of chancers like you, and you ain't changin' my mind.~
@9551 = ~This bounty on Aisha ain't just about a bit of tit for tat, it's about respect, about standing your ground. She stepped out of line, and there's no walking back from that.~
@9552 = ~And you, coming in here, tryna throw your weight around in my business... you've got some cheek. But that's all you've got.~
@9553 = ~This is my manner, my rules. Aisha can stew in her own juice. She's earned it, for the muck she's dragged me through.~
@9554 = ~Now, I'm done nattering. Best scarper off, while you've still got the chance to walk away.~
@9555 = ~Alright, if words aren't enough, then let's talk gold. Everything has a price.~
@9556 = ~There's got to be something you want or need that I can provide. What about a trade?~
@9557 = ~Maybe there's another kind of currency we can deal in? Information, connections, something you can't buy with gold.~
@9558 = ~Enough's enough, I'm fed up with all this yammering. No favors, no deals, nothing's going to change my mind. Just get out of my face and go back to Aisha.~
@9559 = ~If it ain't you who sorts her out, someone else is gonna step up, and that'll work for me. I'm through with her games, and I'm through with this conversation.~
@9560 = ~Don't push your luck, mate. I've got other means to handle this, and I don't need you complicating things further.~
@9561 = ~Ha! Now we're speaking my language! Gold does make the world go 'round, doesn't it? Alright, you've piqued my interest.~
@9562 = ~But for me to forget the whole thing, scrub the bounty, and swallow my pride... it'll cost you. Not just a few coins, mind you. I'm talking about a grand sum... 1000 gold pieces.~
@9563 = ~That's my price. Pay up, and Aisha's free as a bird. Otherwise, you can forget about it.~
@9564 = ~That's quite the sum. I don't have that much on me right now, but I'll be back with it. Just keep that bounty on hold.~
@9565 = ~That's a steep price, but if it'll settle this, then fine. I'll pay the 1000 gold.~
@9566 = ~You're out of your mind, Amrius. I'm not paying that. I'll find another way to sort this out with Aisha.~
@9567 = ~You think I can just pause a bounty like it's some tavern tab? It's out there now, isn't it?~
@9568 = ~You better scrape together those coins quick, 'cause I can't promise how long before someone else decides to cash in. This ain't a game, mate. Hustle up with that gold.~
@9569 = ~Well, I'll be... You're actually gonna cough up a grand for that harlot? You're either daft or too flush with gold. Either way, suits me fine.~
@9570 = ~I'll get the bounty lifted, you have my word. Never thought I'd see the day someone'd pay that much for a bit of tavern scuffle. Off with you then, I've got business to sort.~
@9571 = ~Right then, off you go, back to Aisha. Have your chat, see what she spins this time. You're looking for truth in a web of lies, but who am I to stop you?~
@9572 = ~Just remember, stories change depending on who's telling 'em. So, take whatever she says with a grain of salt, mate.~
@9573 = ~And if you ever find yourself doubting, well, you know where to find me. We'll see how long it takes before you realize who's playing who in this little drama of ours.~
@9574 = ~Back again, are ya? Make it quick, I've got better things to do than chew the fat all day.~
@9575 = ~Amrius, I've got the 1000 gold. It's a steep price, but if it's what it takes to settle this whole mess, then so be it.~
@9576 = ~What'll it take to get that bounty gone? Everything has a price.~
@9577 = ~I've just spoken with Aisha, and I'm starting to see what you meant. She went off on a tangent about Ilena and jealousy that was pretty intense.~
@9578 = ~I heard Ilena might have been looking to chat with you. Has she stopped by recently?~
@9579 = ~Fair enough. I don't have anything pressing at the moment. I'll leave you to your business.~
@9580 = ~Ha! I knew it! I told you, didn't I? Aisha's as unpredictable as they come. One minute she's sweet as pie, the next she's a raging inferno.~
@9581 = ~And when she gets going about Ilena? Oh, that's a sight to behold! You saw it yourself, mate. It's like trying to reason with a storm. Can't be done.~
@9582 = ~She's got this wild side that just bursts out without warning. It's why I had to put that bounty on her. You can't have that kind of unpredictability running wild. It's dangerous.~
@9583 = ~But you've seen it now with your own eyes, so you know I wasn't just spinning tales.~
@9584 = ~Well, given everything that's happened, what do you think is the best course of action now?~
@9585 = ~What can you tell me about Ilena. You think it's worth hearing her side of this?~
@9586 = ~After seeing Aisha's true colors, it seems like the only logical step is to go ahead and cash in on that bounty.~
@9587 = ~Best course of action? It's what I've been saying from the start, the bounty on Aisha needs to be seen through. She's too unpredictable, too volatile.~
@9588 = ~With someone like her, you never know what kind of havoc she'll wreak next. It's not just about settling a personal score anymore, it's about safety, stability.~
@9589 = ~As long as she's out there, with her wild swings and that temper, there's no telling what damage she could do.~
@9590 = ~Taking her out... it's harsh, I know, but it's the only way this ends without more chaos. It's the only way to put a stop to this cycle of madness once and for all.~
@9591 = ~Ilena? Nah, mate, don't bother with her. She was just some bird I was chatting with that night, nothing significant.~
@9592 = ~Look, Ilena's got nothing to do with all this mess between me and Aisha. She was just there, you know, wrong place, wrong time. It's not like she's a key player in this or anything.~
@9593 = ~Best not to drag her into it. We've got enough drama as it is, and involving her would just complicate things unnecessarily.~
@9594 = ~Stick to sorting out things with Aisha, that's where the real problem is.~
@9595 = ~After getting the full Aisha experience, I can't say I'm surprised you've come to that conclusion. It's a tough call, but that's are part of the game, innit?~
@9596 = ~You're doing the right thing, handling the bounty. It's a messy business, but it needs doing. She's brought this on herself, really.~
@9597 = ~Just be careful, yeah? Aisha's full of surprises, and not the pleasant kind. Make sure you're prepared for whatever she might throw your way.~
@9598 = ~Yeah, Ilena popped in, didn't she? Should've known you had a hand in that. She's got her ways, making you see the other side of the coin and all that.~
@9599 = ~So yeah, I'm scrapping the bounty on Aisha. Don't often flip my decisions, but Ilena made a fair point or two.~
@9600 = ~Better to let this storm pass than keep kickin' up a fuss. Aisha's a right handful, but this ain't the way to sort it, is it?~
@9601 = ~Just hope I'm not making a mistake by letting her off the hook. But there it is, the bounty's off. Happy now?~
@9602 = ~It was the right move, and it's better for everyone this way. Let's put this whole mess behind us.~
@9603 = ~It's not always easy to change course, but it often leads to better outcomes. Thank you for reconsidering.~
@9604 = ~I guess it's smarter to avoid the extra hassle. Aisha's not worth the trouble anyway.~
@9605 = ~Yeah, you're probably right. Sometimes you gotta step back, reassess the situation. It's done now, the bounty's off, and hopefully, this'll calm the waters a bit.~
@9606 = ~We'll see if Aisha takes this chance to cool off and sort herself out. Anyway, I've got other matters to attend to, other fires to put out.~
@9607 = ~Let's just hope this decision doesn't come back to bite us. Alright, I'm off then.~
@9608 = ~So, word's out about Aisha. The deed's done, contract settled. It's a grim game we play, isn't it?~
@9609 = ~Thought I knew what I wanted, slapping that price on her head... but it hits different when it's all over.~
@9610 = ~Didn't quite picture it ending like this. Just something you do in the spur of the moment, but then it sticks with you.~
@9611 = ~Well, that's that, no turning the clock back. Got to crack on with other things now.~
