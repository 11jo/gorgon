@7000 = ~Stumbling into the heart of the Gorgon's Eye is no mere accident. Few find us without intent, and even fewer leave without consequence.~
@7001 = ~But let's not dally on pleasantries or warnings. You're either here with a purpose or lost beyond your depth. State your business, or find your exit swiftly.~
@7002 = ~The shadows here are less forgiving to those who linger without cause.~
@7003 = ~I find myself here by chance. What is the significance of this place?~
@7004 = ~I'm interested in joining your operation. How could I go about doing that?~
@7005 = ~I think I'll be leaving now.~
@7006 = ~Ah, chance is but a mask fate wears when it wishes to remain unseen. Intriguing that it led you here, to the heart of whispers and shadows.~
@7007 = ~We're an organization that thrives in the currency of secrets and earned trust, not the idle curiosity of those who stumble upon our doorstep.~
@7008 = ~Perhaps, in time, the significance you seek might reveal itself, but for now, it remains shrouded, as do the deepest truths of our world.~
@7009 = ~Ah, a bold aspiration to mingle with the shadows of the Gorgon's Eye. Your audacity is as commendable as it is foolhardy.~
@7010 = ~Baldwin, the guildmaster, is the mind that discerns such matters. If it's a place among us you seek, he's the one you need to convince.~
@7011 = ~But tread carefully, for the path to our inner circle is lined with more than mere shadows. It's a labyrinth where only the astute and the cunning find their way.~
@7012 = ~Let this be your first lesson: in our world, every step is a gamble, and not everyone emerges from the shadows unscathed.~
@7013 = ~A wise choice. Let this encounter be a shadowed memory, for our secrets have a way of silencing those who speak too freely.~
@7014 = ~Exiting gracefully is often the wisest choice in a place like this. The shadows here have their own way of complicating matters, and you may not like the outcome.~
@7015 = ~Welcome to the shadowed embrace of the Gorgon's Eye, friend. Baldwin has spoken, and you have been deemed worthy to begin our trials.~
@7016 = ~I am Rigaldo, master of intrigue and subterfuge, and my role within this guild is to guide and assess the potential of those who dare to enter our realm.~
@7017 = ~My experience in the world of thievery and covert operations spans countless years, and I know these treacherous streets like the veins on my own hand.~
@7018 = ~It is my duty to evaluate your skills, your cunning, and your ability to navigate the intricate shadows that define our existence.~
@7019 = ~As we embark on your trials, remember that every step you take may bring you closer to the heart of our secrets, or plunge you further into darkness.~
@7020 = ~But heed my words, for I do not suffer the unworthy lightly.~
@7021 = ~The Gorgon's Eye thrives on discretion. Your resolve and resourcefulness will be tested, unveiling facets of this world that remain concealed from the uninitiated.~
@7022 = ~And remember, we trade in hidden truths, not idle chatter. Ask your questions, and let us proceed with your trials.~
@7023 = ~Why do you and Baldwin have the appearance of Shadow Thieves?~
@7024 = ~Can you tell me anything about the other guild members I might be working with?~
@7025 = ~What are the trials like, and how can I best prepare for them?~
@7026 = ~I'm ready to begin. What is my first mission?~
@7027 = ~And how, pray tell, have you become privy to the visage of a Shadow Thief?~
@7028 = ~I've seen their image in various tomes and scrolls when growing up in Candlekeep.~
@7029 = ~I grew up in Candlekeep, where its walls of knowledge provided me with insights on various lore.~
@7030 = ~I've heard about them through tales and stories, passed down during my time in Candlekeep.~
@7031 = ~I have my doubts if any book could yield reliable information of such a secretive organization. Yet, if such knowledge exists, it would indeed be nestled among the hallowed halls of Candlekeep.~
@7032 = ~You are perceptive, however. Baldwin and I once bore the mantle of the Shadow Thieves, but our affiliations have long since diverged.~
@7033 = ~Very well, let me introduce you to the key players of our guild. Listen closely, as it will not be repeated.~
@7034 = ~First, there's Ariosh, master of the alley. He's the eyes and ears in Beregost. If someone's coming or going, he knows, and more importantly, he knows what they carry with them.~
@7035 = ~He's also our mediator with the City Watch, smoothing things over, and handling any misunderstandings that may arise.~
@7036 = ~Rhade is our blacksmith and fence. His hands craft more than metal, and he has deep connections in the black market's underbelly. If you need rare goods, he's your shadow in the forge.~
@7037 = ~Liedel, the mistress of bounties, a shadow in the night. She handles the contracts for hunting and killing. Beware her charm, it's as sharp as her blade.~
@7038 = ~Zeda, the ghost of smuggling, a wraith in the shadows. If trouble's brewing, her nose twitches first. She's also a priestess, her healing hands able to mend more than just physical wounds.~
@7039 = ~And finally, Baldwin, our guildmaster. His determination and ambition are unmatched, as ruthless as he is resourceful.~
@7040 = ~He carved this guild from the void, shaped it with bare hands and iron will. Cross him at your peril.~
@7041 = ~These are our shadows, our silent movers. Know them, but never fully. In our world, secrets are currency, and trust is earned in whispers and deeds.~
@7042 = ~They are not for the faint of heart, nor the clumsy of hand. You'll be tested on the core arts of our trade. Expect challenges that will probe the depth of your cunning and skill.~
@7043 = ~For stealth, you must move like a ghost, make no more sound than a breath. The shadows should be your cloak, and silence, your ally. Practice patience in your steps, secrecy in your movements.~
@7044 = ~In the art of theft, it's about finesse and timing. Watch, wait, and strike with precision. You must learn to read people, their habits, distractions. Your touch should be as light as a whisper.~
@7045 = ~Safe-cracking will demand precision and a keen eye. Feel their secrets, listen to their whispers. Familiarize yourself with various locks and tools. Patience is your ally.~
@7046 = ~And then, there's the art of persuasion. Words are your mask, your dagger. Know your mark, their desires and fears.~
@7047 = ~Convincing a target requires more than just silver-tongued speech, it demands an understanding of the human psyche.~
@7048 = ~So, sharpen your skills, refine your senses. These trials aren't just tests; they're your initiation into the true art of thievery.~
@7049 = ~Alright, you're eager to start, I see. Very well, I've tailored a task to test the stealth of your step and the deftness of your fingers.~
@7050 = ~It's a game of shadows, where your sleight of hand and ability to move unseen will be your ticket to success.~
@7051 = ~You see, there's a fence passing through our town, goes by the name 'Zieke'. A slick character, with a real nice sparkler on him, a diamond from Waterdeep. It's your job to make it ours.~
@7052 = ~Zieke's on the move, planning to meet a buyer at the carnival down south. He won't be lingering, so timing is key.~
@7053 = ~He's currently holed up at Feldpost's Inn, a fortress of his own making, surrounded by his loyal guards. They're like a pack of wolves, sharp and watchful, circling his room.~
@7054 = ~They keep a tight seal on his privacy, eyes peeled for any unwanted visitors. Zieke's up there now, cloistered away with that diamond, thinking he's untouchable.~
@7055 = ~What can you tell me about these guards? Any details I should know about?~
@7056 = ~Who exactly is Zieke? What's his demeanor, any habits or quirks that I can use to my advantage?~
@7057 = ~How long is he planning to stay in town? Do we have a window of opportunity, or is this a race against time?~
@7058 = ~I'll get the diamond. You'll hear from me when the job's done.~
@7059 = ~They're swarming the place. We've seen them at the bar, whispering over their ales. Outside, eyes sharp, keeping a tight watch on the door like hawks.~
@7060 = ~They're in the halls too, patrolling like sentinels. Their numbers make them impossible to miss, so use that to your advantage.~
@7061 = ~But don't underestimate the challenge. You'll need to slip past them, silent as a ghost. One wrong move, one shifty glance, and you'll light up like a beacon.~
@7062 = ~If they catch a whiff of something off, the whole operation's blown. Consider grabbing a little something from Rhade. His tools have a way of persuading things to go quiet, if you catch my drift.~
@7063 = ~But don't get too carried away. For this job, it's best to keep things quiet, leave no ripples.~
@7064 = ~Inquisitive, aren't we? Good, intelligence is key in our line of work. Zieke, he's a peculiar one. A renowned fence from Waterdeep, with a reputation as grand as his wares.~
@7065 = ~The man's got style, flair, but don't let that fool you. Underneath that rogue's charm lies a mind sharp as a dagger and twice as dangerous.~
@7066 = ~However, he's paranoid, obsessed with privacy. Doesn't even trust his own guards in his room. Use that to your advantage. That's your in, an angle you can exploit.~
@7067 = ~Sneak in while he's wrapped in his cloak of solitude. Be as quiet as a shadow, as swift as a whisper. Get in, get the diamond, get out. No one's the wiser.~
@7068 = ~Zieke's stay is fleeting, a shadow at dusk. He'll be gone in a few days, maybe less, and time waits for no one, especially not for us.~
@7069 = ~Get in, get the job done, and don't let distractions cost us this opportunity. We need that diamond, and we need it now.~
@7070 = ~Let this mission be your canvas, and your skill the brush. Paint us a picture of dexterity and stealth. ~
@7071 = ~Move with precision, strike with subtlety. This task is not just about acquiring a gem; it's about proving your worth, asserting your place among us.~
@7072 = ~Remember, the night has many eyes and ears. Keep your wits about you, blend with the darkness, and let your actions speak.~
@7073 = ~Go now, and I'll await your successful return. Avoid distractions, and focus on the prize. The guild watches, the night whispers, and fortune, my friend, favors the bold.~
@7074 = ~Time's a thief that waits for no one. Snatch that jewel swiftly, or our chance will vanish into the night. This isn't a leisurely stroll, it's a race against the sands of time.~
@7075 = ~I had eyes on you, in case the night turned sour. Now, let's cut through the murk and see where we stand.~
@7076 = ~Do you have the prize? Show it here, let's have a look under the light. We need to make sure it's the gem we're after, not some fool's gold.~
@7077 = ~Got the diamond right here.~
@7078 = ~What shadow of thought clouded your mind? Approaching Zieke so brazenly? I told you, the man's a fortress of solitude.~
@7079 = ~You can't just waltz in expecting him to open his vaults and share a cup of tea. Stealth and subtlety, remember? We're shadows, not clanging cymbals.~
@7080 = ~And amidst your daring display, did the gem stay firmly in your grasp, or did it slip through like shadows in the fray? Tell me you didn't scatter our prize to the winds in your hasty retreat.~
@7081 = ~Got the gem right here.~
@7082 = ~Now that's the mark of a true shadow. You glided in and out, unseen, unheard, like a whisper in the dark. The diamond's ours, and not a single soul is the wiser.~
@7083 = ~That's the art of true thievery. You've shown finesse and cunning that would make the most seasoned rogue nod in respect. Well done.~
@7084 = ~You've got the gem, but stirred the hornet's nest, didn't you? Remember, in our world, patience is more than a virtue, it's your cloak and dagger.~
@7085 = ~You've shown guts, but finesse is what makes a master thief. Learn to dance with the shadows, blend with them. You'll get there, with time and practice.~
@7086 = ~Nip the theatrics next time and employ a bit of stealth. Our craft isn't about brute force, it's about moving unseen, striking without a trace.~
@7087 = ~Sure, the job's done, but it's a risky game, drawing that much attention. This might bring the City Watch down on our heads.~
@7088 = ~Next time, weave through the night quietly. We're in the business of silence, not spectacle.~
@7089 = ~Hand over the diamond, then. In exchange, I've got a little something for you. Crafted it with my own hands, a little trinket that's more than meets the eye.~
@7090 = ~You'll find it invaluable in your forthcoming escapades of cunning and thievery. Consider it a token of your initiation, and a tool for the artful deeds yet to come.~
@7091 = ~For your next test, we're lurking deeper, beyond the shadows, straight into the lion's den.~
@7092 = ~Gerard Travenhurst, the bloke who considers himself a lord, resides in a grand manor here in Beregost.~
@7093 = ~He once sought our 'protection', but now, he's turned his back on us, favoring his hired swords over our subtle safeguarding.~
@7094 = ~Your mission is to infiltrate his manor, a testament to his newfound confidence and misplaced trust.~
@7095 = ~Inside, you'll find a safe, tucked away in the shadows of his upper chambers. It houses his most prized possession, a family heirloom, a necklace, rich in history and value.~
@7096 = ~I want you to crack it open, and claim that necklace. This will test your finesse with locks and your ability to navigate the guarded corridors of his manor.~
@7097 = ~But the task doesn't end there. Once that bauble is in your hands, you'll have a little chat with Gerard himself.~
@7098 = ~Show him the flaw in his armor, the ease with which his treasures can be whisked away. Make it clear that our protection is not a luxury but a necessity.~
@7099 = ~If he's wise, he'll resume his payments. Use that necklace as leverage if needed, a chess piece in your game of smooth persuasion or calculated intimidation.~
@7100 = ~Employ your cunning, your confidence, your words. This is a dance of diplomacy as much as it is a heist.~
@7101 = ~What should I do if he refuses to resume his payments, even after I've shown him the vulnerability of his security?~
@7102 = ~After negotiating with Gerard, should I return the necklace to him, or bring it back to the guild's coffers?~
@7103 = ~Will there be any backup or support available in case the situation inside the manor escalates unexpectedly?~
@7104 = ~I believe I've got everything clear. Break in, get the necklace, and negotiate with Gerard. I'm ready to go.~
@7105 = ~If Travenhurst proves stubborn and refuses to bend, then you'll need to apply a firmer hand. Make an example of his guards if necessary.~
@7106 = ~Remember, in our world, sometimes the subtler arts must give way to more direct methods. It's a harsh lesson, but in our line of work, niceties are often a luxury we can't afford.~
@7107 = ~Should the necklace not be needed as leverage, bring it back to us. I'll ensure you get a fair share of its value.~
@7108 = ~It'll serve as a stark reminder to Gerard of the folly in crossing paths with us. It's not just about the monetary worth, it's about sending a clear message.~
@7109 = ~I've got eyes on the situation. You're still proving your mettle, so it's crucial we see how you handle things solo.~
@7110 = ~But rest assured, if the waters turn too turbulent, my men will step in. It's a balance, letting you navigate the mission while ensuring the guild's interests aren't compromised.~
@7111 = ~Your clarity and readiness speak well of your potential. Remember, this mission is as much about wits as it is about skill.~
@7112 = ~Infiltrate Travenhurst's manor, secure the necklace, and then, the dance of words with Gerard.~
@7113 = ~It's a delicate symmetry of threat and persuasion, a test of your ability to navigate the murky waters of negotiation. Keep your senses sharp, your mind clearer.~
@7114 = ~Use the shadows as your ally, and let your words be as precise as your lockpicks. This is more than a simple theft, it's a statement, a demonstration of our reach and influence.~
@7115 = ~Return successful, and you've not only secured a valuable asset but also proven your worth to the guild.~
@7116 = ~We're more than just thieves, we're architects of influence and power. Go now, with the stealth of the night and the cunning of a fox. Make us proud.~
@7117 = ~You've got a mission at hand, remember? The necklace from Travenhurst's manor won't steal itself. Focus on the task, and only return once you've danced with danger and emerged victorious.~
@7118 = ~So, tell me about your encounter with Gerard. I trust you've managed to persuade him to resume his contributions to our coffers?~
@7119 = ~Of course, in the interest of formality, I ask, though you and I both know that my eyes and ears are ever-present.~
@7120 = ~Your actions, your choices on this mission were observed, not to evade your privacy, but to gauge your competence.~
@7121 = ~Now, recount your tale, officially, so we may conclude this trial with the proper decorum befitting the Gorgon's Eye.~
@7122 = ~I managed to successfully negotiate with Gerard. It took some persuasion, but he saw reason and agreed to resume his payments.~
@7123 = ~Negotiations with Gerard broke down. His guards were killed in the confrontation, but it led to him agreeing to resume his payments.~
@7124 = ~You chose to wield your strength through words, a wise decision. Commanding respect and fear with just your tone and presence is a skill few master.~
@7125 = ~Gerard's compliance, earned through your intimidating persuasion, shows you understand the power of controlled force in negotiation.~
@7126 = ~Ah, so you used your intellect to outmaneuver Gerard. That's the mark of a true strategist. Confronting a noble with logic and foresight is no small feat.~
@7127 = ~Your ability to think and plan is a valuable asset to the guild. It's always satisfying to see brains triumph over brawn.~
@7128 = ~Wisdom as your tool of choice, impressive. Convincing Gerard through insight and understanding is a subtle art.~
@7129 = ~It shows depth in your character and an ability to see beyond the immediate. Such qualities are rare and speak volumes of your potential within our ranks.~
@7130 = ~Charisma, a powerful tool in the right hands, and it seems yours are quite adept.~
@7131 = ~Swinging Gerard with charm and presence is no easy task. It requires a certain finesse, and you've demonstrated that in spades. Your persuasive abilities will serve the guild well.~
@7132 = ~It's unfortunate that it came down to a deadly confrontation. However, the guild understands that sometimes, such measures are necessary.~
@7133 = ~You did what you had to do, and Gerard's compliance, albeit forced, is the result we needed.~
@7134 = ~It's a messy solution, but effectiveness in our line of work often requires making the hard choices.~
@7135 = ~Now, let's discuss the incident at Gerard's manor. I've been informed about your encounter with another player at the safe.~
@7136 = ~You handled it with the efficiency and discretion we value in our guild. Such unexpected complications are part of the job, and you adapted well.~
@7137 = ~He mentioned something about Blackthorn. Is that a name I should know?~
@7138 = ~Blackthorn? Just a small-time cutthroat trying to stir up trouble. His gang is nothing but a ragtag bunch of misfits, barely noticeable in our world.~
@7139 = ~But let's turn our attention to Gerard's necklace. It's a significant piece of this puzzle, not just for its value, but for what it represents in our delicate dance of power and influence.~
@7140 = ~So, you decided to keep Gerard's necklace. Good, it adds to our coffers and serves as a harsh lesson for Gerard - don't cross the Gorgon's Eye.~
@7141 = ~But such actions come with their own consequences. It will undoubtedly increase animosity and could escalate tensions. We'll need to be prepared for any repercussions that might follow.~
@7142 = ~Well, hand it over then, the guild will make good use of it. And don't worry, you'll get your fair cut for this job well done.~
@7143 = ~Here's the necklace, exactly as I found it.~
@7144 = ~I seem to have misplaced it after leaving Gerard's.~
@7145 = ~I'm aware you returned Gerard's necklace to him. There's merit in that, it eases tension and avoids unnecessary hostility, which can be beneficial in the long run.~
@7146 = ~However, it also means a lost opportunity for profit, and it might have sent a stronger message if we'd kept it as a reminder to Gerard not to cross us.~
@7147 = ~Gerard seemed to understand the message loud and clear without that extra reminder. It felt like the right call at the time.~
@7148 = ~It seemed like returning it would maintain a better balance, avoiding unnecessary complications or backlash.~
@7149 = ~Actually, I swiped the necklace back off Gerard before leaving. I thought it best to give the impression of returning it, but still keep the upper hand by actually taking it with me.~
@7150 = ~You took Gerard's necklace but don't have it with you? That's a careless move, even for a novice. You went through the effort to obtain a valuable asset, only to lose it?~
@7151 = ~This isn't just about missing out on profits, it's about reputation. We operate in the shadows, and we must always be sharp and precise. Let this be a lesson in attention to detail.~
@7152 = ~Your judgment in the field is crucial, and it's clear you gave this some thought. Avoiding further complications and ensuring a clear message was received by Gerard shows strategic thinking.~
@7153 = ~It's important to strike a balance between assertion and restraint. Your ability to assess and act accordingly is a valuable trait in this line of work.~
@7154 = ~Let's hope Gerard continues to see things as clearly as he did in your encounter.~
@7155 = ~Remarkable... You've truly outdone yourself. To elude even the eyes of my own men, and to outwit Gerard so deftly, that is the art of a true thief!~
@7156 = ~Such cunning and sleight of hand are rare, even among our ranks. You've demonstrated not just skill, but a deep understanding of the subtleties of our craft.~
@7157 = ~It's this very prowess in the shadows that defines the essence of the Gorgon's Eye. You've shown a natural instinct for the game we play, and this certainly bodes well for your future here.~
@7158 = ~With this, you've successfully passed your final trial. Welcome to the fold, <CHARNAME>, you're now an official member of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@7159 = ~This is not merely a title, but a commitment laden with responsibilities and opportunities. The shadows we operate in are deep and ever-shifting, and your skills will be crucial in navigating them.~
@7160 = ~Ariosh is your contact for work on the streets. His knowledge of the city's underbelly is invaluable for our operations.~
@7161 = ~For those with a taste for the hunt, Liedel's the one to see for a list of open bounties. She's a resourceful individual with a keen eye for profitable targets.~
@7162 = ~And of course, the guild is often abuzz with various assignments, each with its own rewards and challenges.~
@7163 = ~Above all, Baldwin has requested your presence. In our hierarchy, the guildmaster's summons is not to be taken lightly.~
@7164 = ~I suggest you collect your assignments and report in without delay. He'll likely have insights and directives critical to your new role within our ranks.~
@7165 = ~Remember, as part of the Gorgon's Eye, you are now woven into a tapestry of intrigue and power. Every move you make, every treasure you uncover, strengthens our collective dominion.~
@7166 = ~Your path with us is just beginning, and I have high expectations for your future contributions. The shadows of our guild hold many secrets, and your role in uncovering them is just beginning.~
@7167 = ~Settle your affairs with Baldwin, then we'll discuss the other jobs on the table.~
@7168 = ~Ah, you return, seeking yet another chapter in our endless dance with fortune and shadow.~
@7169 = ~It seems the winds of fate have whispered a peculiar tale from the reaches of Nashkel. A task beckons, one shrouded in mystery and ripe for your unique talents.~
@7170 = ~In the folds of a farmer's field, a woman named Karp has unearthed relics of arcane nature. Among her discoveries, a pair of rings, destined for a buyer from Ulgoth's Beard, who is en route even now.~
@7171 = ~Our sources reveal a dual intrigue. Firstly, this Karp eschews the light of legitimate commerce, favoring the murky dealings with fences and shadows of our ilk.~
@7172 = ~Secondly, she veils her finds from the eyes of her spouse, a fact that may prove pivotal in your endeavor. Your journey southward should be marked by discretion and astute judgment.~
@7173 = ~The path you tread could be one of extortion, wielding the hidden sword of her secret as leverage, or perhaps an artful masquerade, adopting the guise of her expected buyer.~
@7174 = ~Should these avenues falter, the looming shadow of threat may yet yield results. And for those who favor the silent art of thievery, the direct liberation of these items remains an option.~
@7175 = ~Succeed in securing these rings before they vanish into the vastness of the market, and you shall be rewarded.~
@7176 = ~A token of our esteem, one of these rings, shall pass to your keeping. Let it serve as a reminder of our mutually beneficial accord.~
@7177 = ~The shadows of secrets hold power. I shall use the veil of her hidden truths as leverage.~
@7178 = ~I'll don the guise of her expected buyer from Ulgoth's Beard, and use my cunning to acquire the rings.~
@7179 = ~Sometimes, fear is the most effective tool. I'll cast a shadow of dread upon her, enough to loosen her grip on those rings.~
@7180 = ~Subtlety and silence shall be my allies. I will relieve her of these rings as a shadow in the night.~
@7181 = ~The path is not yet clear to me. I'll observe and adapt as the situation unfolds, keeping my options open.~
@7182 = ~I will seek a path of understanding and resolution. Dialogue may reveal a solution beneficial to all.~
@7183 = ~Your path is yours to choose, and the shadows shall bear witness to your journey.~
@7184 = ~Remember, the essence of our craft lies not in the deed itself, but in its silent execution and the ripples it leaves in its wake.~
@7185 = ~Let discretion be your guide, and let not the light of day unveil the works done under the cloak of night.~
@7186 = ~Return with the rings, and your efforts shall be duly rewarded. Tread carefully, for the path you walk is lined with eyes unseen.~
@7187 = ~Should your presence here be more than mere chance, and you bear the fruits of your latest endeavor, then speak.~
@7188 = ~Here are the rings, as promised.~
@7189 = ~I'm still working on it.~
@7190 = ~Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, and your reward awaits. As promised, one ring is yours, a symbol of our enduring partnership.~
@7191 = ~Choose your path wisely, for the shadows are ever watchful, and the choices you make echo in the silent halls of our world.~
@7192 = ~Conclude your dealings with Ariosh. A task lies ahead demanding both of your undivided attention, keen and cutting as twin blades.~
@7193 = ~Ah, you've returned to the shadows from whence you thrive. It's time we set your talents to a task of delicate precision.~
@7194 = ~South, at the carnival in Nashkel, a subtle game is afoot, one that requires your deft hands and silent steps.~
@7195 = ~The Gamesmen, they wield weapons not of steel but of cunning, stun darts, potent enough to turn the tides of fortune.~
@7196 = ~These darts, hidden within the grandeur of the two large gambling tents on the western wing of the carnival, are your quarry.~
@7197 = ~Your mission is to infiltrate the carnival, relieve the Gamesmen of their hidden arsenals without stirring the winds of suspicion.~
@7198 = ~Once you've secured these stun darts, rendezvous with Ariosh and his men. They'll be lurking like shadows behind the tents, awaiting your signal.~
@7199 = ~Equip them with the Gamesmen's own tools of trade. What follows is a play of irony, using their own kit to usurp their winnings and, most crucially, their gambling licenses.~
@7200 = ~Now, once you've handed over the darts to Ariosh, your part in this night's play concludes. Your presence will be required back here, for there are more threads in this web to untangle.~
@7201 = ~The carnival is but the opening act of a grander scheme. Return promptly, for the shadows await your next endeavor.~
@7202 = ~What's the significance of the gambling licenses? Is there a larger purpose behind acquiring them?~
@7203 = ~The carnival falls under Shadow Thief influence. Should I expect any complications?~
@7204 = ~Do we have an estimate on the number of Gamesmen inside those tents?~
@7205 = ~I understand the mission. I'm ready to head down to the carnival.~
@7206 = ~The gambling licenses are a keystone to our broader strategy. They will serve to legitimize several of our covert casino operations.~
@7207 = ~By operating under legal pretenses, we can mask our more clandestine activities, funneling resources without drawing undue attention.~
@7208 = ~We're playing the game by its rules to bend them in our favor. This allows us to expand our influence in plain sight, yet remain shielded by the guise of legality.~
@7209 = ~It's a tactical move, blending power with subtlety, an art we excel in.~
@7210 = ~Indeed, the carnival lies within the domain of the Shadow Thieves, and they will surely be apprised of your visit.~
@7211 = ~But fear not, their main force lies beyond the Cloud Peaks, leaving their presence sparse in these northern regions.~
@7212 = ~They seldom engage in large operations this far north. Thus, your mission should encounter minimal interference.~
@7213 = ~It's an opportune moment to strike, taking advantage of the thin spread of their operatives.~
@7214 = ~I admire your foresight in seeking such details. Preparedness is a trait of the prudent. There are eight Gamesmen in total, evenly divided with four in each tent.~
@7215 = ~This information should aid in strategizing your approach. Remember, subtlety and discretion are paramount.~
@7216 = ~Each Gamesman is a cog in their operation, removing them quietly will be instrumental in ensuring the success of our endeavor.~
@7217 = ~Your readiness marks the beginning of a significant chapter in our expansion into Amn. This mission at the carnival is but the first step in a larger dance of power and influence.~
@7218 = ~Your role is crucial, a testament to the trust we place in your abilities. Go now, with the shadows as your ally.~
@7219 = ~Let this mission be the herald of our reach extending beyond its current bounds, a signal of the dawning of a new era under our sway.~
@7220 = ~Return upon completion, for there are further plans where your skills will be instrumental.~
@7221 = ~Be mindful, this endeavor is of substantial magnitude, leaving no margin for error. Ensure that you meticulously relieve each Gamesman of their gear prior to signaling our brethren.~
@7222 = ~Once this crucial phase is executed with precision, Ariosh will assume the reins. The success of this operation hinges on flawless execution at every step.~
@7223 = ~The echoes of your deeds at the carnival have already reached my ears, resonating with the unmistakable timbre of success.~
@7224 = ~Your adeptness in the art of clandestine operations reinforces your esteemed place amongst our enigmatic fold.~
@7225 = ~With the acquisition of these gambling licenses, we unfurl the first chapter of a more ambitious narrative.~
@7226 = ~These documents are not mere paper and ink, but the foundational stones upon which we shall erect our influence in the south.~
@7227 = ~Your role in this has been pivotal, and now, as we orchestrate the silent takeover of power, we stand on the cusp of extending our reach, weaving our web into the edges of Amn.~
@7228 = ~The ground is set; the shadows lengthen. Our journey southward begins.~
@7229 = ~A pause in our grand design is upon us as we meticulously prepare for our advance into Amn.~
@7230 = ~While the gears of our operation are being set into motion, I urge you to address any remaining affairs within our guild's domain.~
@7231 = ~The time has come to discuss Nashkel, a realm distinct in its challenges.~
@7232 = ~Unlike the territories where the Flaming Fist's influence wanes, Nashkel is a fortress of order, guarded by an army with iron discipline.~
@7233 = ~Our movements there must be as imperceptible as a shadow on a moonlit night.~
@7234 = ~The Shadow Thieves, our enigmatic counterparts, have their influence south of the Cloud Peaks, their presence here a mere whisper. Yet, caution is our watchword, as even whispers can herald a storm.~
@7235 = ~Your next undertaking is to locate our associate, Procus. He will be amongst the throngs at the carnival, near the jousting lists.~
@7236 = ~His role, and consequently yours, is pivotal in establishing our foothold amidst the carnival's chaos. The area itself provides a tapestry of faces and diversions, an ideal veil for our endeavors.~
@7237 = ~Meld with the crowd, carve out our niche, but remain vigilant. In this den of revelry, our success hinges on guile and discretion.~
@7238 = ~Now, before your departure south, a detour to Gilbald's is in order. A matter has arisen that requires your discerning eye.~
@7239 = ~We cannot afford oversights in our ranks, such negligence can unravel the most elaborate plans.~
@7240 = ~Also, Liedel, the ever diligent sentinel, has amassed a new collection of bounties. Her persistence is a testament to her dedication.~
@7241 = ~Indulge her, if you will, and then we can refocus on the matters that truly demand our cunning.~
@7242 = ~Your role in this is not merely an errand but a cornerstone in maintaining the equilibrium of our clandestine symphony.~
@7243 = ~Maintain a vigilant ear, <CHARNAME>. Nashkel is akin to a capricious enchantress, her moods ever-changing, and we stand at the precipice of our grand endeavor within her bounds.~
@7244 = ~Back within the enigmatic embrace of our lair, swift and incisive as ever, aren't you?~
@7245 = ~The echoes of your recent triumphs in Nashkel have swiftly found their way to me, carried on the clandestine currents of our underworld.~
@7246 = ~Our intricate venture is unfolding with precision, a tapestry woven by your adept hands.~
@7247 = ~The gold acquired, the networks of influence you've entwined, it's all coalescing splendidly, aligning with our most ambitious designs.~
@7248 = ~The Gorgon's Eye, under our guidance, is etching its indelible mark upon the world, and you, my friend, are at the heart of this intricate web.~
@7249 = ~Your contributions have not gone unnoticed, they resonate with the finesse of a masterful conductor.~
@7250 = ~Well done, indeed. We are but steps away from realizing the full extent of our vision, a testament to your unwavering dedication and skill.~
@7251 = ~At present, the wellspring of leads has run dry. I suggest you converse with our guild's brethren, their pursuits may reveal tasks suited to your particular skills.~
@7252 = ~It's time to cast your gaze upon a local enigma, Borland of Beregost. Beneath the guise of a benevolent host to wayward travelers, he veils a more nefarious trade.~
@7253 = ~Borland deals in black lotus, among other spices, substances that dance upon the edge of shadow. Our interest in his operation presents us with a bifurcation of paths.~
@7254 = ~You could weave your way into his confidence, persuading him to share a portion of his illicit profits in exchange for our tacit permission to continue.~
@7255 = ~His operations could thrive under our watchful eye, contributing to our vast coffers. Alternatively, you could dismantle his facade, securing his stock of spice for our possession.~
@7256 = ~In doing so, his enterprise crumbles, and we seize control of the substance's flow within our territory.~
@7257 = ~Each course holds its own merit, a testament to the versatility of our operations. The decision lies with you, a choice between partnership and usurpation.~
@7258 = ~Proceed as you deem fit, but remember, the outcome shall ripple through our guild's future endeavors.~
@7259 = ~Borland's shadowy abode, the nucleus of his clandestine activities, lies discreetly on the east side of town.~
@7260 = ~Seek it out across from the Red Sheaf, where the unsuspecting eye sees only an ordinary dwelling, masking the truth of what lies within.~
@7261 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, back amidst the shadows. Tell me, has our little problem with Borland been resolved, or do the winds still carry whispers of unrest?~
@7262 = ~Borland will be paying us our share. His operation continues, but now under our watchful eye.~
@7263 = ~Borland's operation in Beregost is no more. I've shut it down and acquired his supply.~
@7264 = ~Borland's operation in Beregost is no more. I've shut it down.~
@7265 = ~I'm still working on it, but I'll get it sorted out soon.~
@7266 = ~A pragmatic approach, indeed. Allowing Borland to continue, yet under our banner, expands our influence and coffers simultaneously.~
@7267 = ~It's a subtle art, weaving control while allowing the facade of independence. Your actions serve as a testament to the cunning and reach of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@7268 = ~This arrangement will send ripples through Beregost, a subtle reminder of our omnipresence. Excellent work. Now, let's focus on leveraging this new development to our further advantage.~
@7269 = ~Here is your cut for the work, a fair share for a job well executed. The Gorgon's Eye values your diligence and skill.~
@7270 = ~A decisive move. Closing down Borland's enterprise cuts off one more unchecked stream in the undercurrent of Beregost. It's a harsh lesson for those who operate outside our influence.~
@7271 = ~Your actions speak to the uncompromising nature of our guild. Let this serve as a reminder to others that the Gorgon's Eye is not to be defied.~
@7272 = ~Well done. Here's your deserved cut, and a bit extra for the Black Lotus you've secured. It's a rare prize that adds to our leverage.~
@7273 = ~Thamuz leads this assault with the same ruthless cunning we once honed together. I have no words left for idle talk amidst this grim dance of old allies.~
@7274 = ~Lean in, my deft companion, for a task beckons that bears your mark.~
@7275 = ~The Avowed, those Candlekeep monks, have whispered through the shadows about a treasure lost, a tome, ripe with hidden lore, vanished like mist.~
@7276 = ~On its journey to the keep it disappeared, snatched from the very road. It seems our reputation for retrieving the elusive has reached even their ears.~
@7277 = ~Of course, they clamor for discretion, as monks are wont to do. Their doctrine, 'Those who destroy knowledge, with ink, fire, or sword, are themselves destroyed.' guides their plea.~
@7278 = ~And you, rumored to be acquainted with Candlekeep's sacred walls, you'll fathom their quirks better than any.~
@7279 = ~I'm tasking you to journey to Baldur's Gate, to parley with Ravenscar, who reigns over the local thieves. They're well-informed, likely to have caught scent of this absconded tome.~
@7280 = ~Seek them out, exchange words, and unearth what they know. But tread lightly, like a shadow's whisper, for that's our way in this game.~
@7281 = ~Do we have any specifics on the stolen tome?~
@7282 = ~What can you tell me about Ravenscar and the thieves guild in Baldur's Gate?~
@7283 = ~Alright, I'll head to the city and speak with Ravenscar.~
@7284 = ~Ravenscar is dead. He thought he could pull a fast one on me, but I showed him otherwise.~
@7285 = ~'Netheril's Grimoire of Lost Arcana', such is the name they've adorned it with, an intriguing moniker for a tome shrouded in mystery.~
@7286 = ~The essence of this artifact, ah, therein lies the true expedition. We speak of arcane secrets, spells lost to time, lost whispers of ancient Netherese wisdom.~
@7287 = ~The monks, they're quivering in their cloisters over its loss, and rightly so.~
@7288 = ~This is no mere collection of parchment, it's a beacon of forgotten power, a relic that commands respect and fear in equal measure.~
@7289 = ~They're a cunning lot, known for their shrewd dealings and keen intellects. They've woven their influence into the fabric of the city, their hands deftly playing in many a secretive venture.~
@7290 = ~The guild, seasoned by time and tribulations, has etched its mark well. Rumors abound of their sprawling network, eyes ever-watchful for opportunities akin to this.~
@7291 = ~As for guild tensions, cast those worries aside. In Ravenscar's domain, we stand on common ground. They, like us, appreciate the art of cooperation in our shadowed profession.~
@7292 = ~No need for blades to flash; keep the discourse smooth, and you'll glean the knowledge we seek.~
@7293 = ~Keep your senses sharp and your demeanor collected. Ravenscar possesses a keen instinct for truth, and he holds in high regard those who deal plainly. A forthright approach will earn his respect.~
@7294 = ~By the shadows, what have you done? Slaying Ravenscar wasn't part of the play! You've unleashed a maelstrom in our world of whispers and guile.~
@7295 = ~We tread a delicate path in the dark, and now you've cast a glaring torch over us all. A war, a bloody war between guilds, could be upon us!~
@7296 = ~This isn't just about your vengeance. Think, for the gods' sake, think about the webs you've tangled!~
@7297 = ~Every last one of them... wiped out? <CHARNAME>, you've razed an entire guild, single-handedly dismantling Ravenscar's reign. This is no mere feat... it's a portent.~
@7298 = ~Baldwin, we tread on a razor's edge. We've a tempest in our midst, and it's edging ever closer. We must proceed with our plans, but with eyes wide open.~
@7299 = ~Venture into the Gate, probe the underbelly, seek out the black markets for the tome.~
@7300 = ~Yet be vigilant, more than ever. <CHARNAME>, your strength is undeniable, a dual-edged blade, and one that could cut us just as deeply.~
@7301 = ~Make haste to Baldur's Gate. Seek out Ravenscar, study the depths of their cunning guild, and pry into what whispers they may harbor about 'Netheril's Grimoire of Lost Arcana'.~
@7302 = ~Make haste to Baldur's Gate, and immerse yourself in the clandestine embrace of the black markets. There, amidst the whispers and shadows, seek out any leads on the 'Netheril's Grimoire of Lost Arcana'.~
@7303 = ~Ah, you emerge from the shadows once more. Have you ensnared that elusive tome in your grasp, or does our game of conceal and seek persist?~
@7304 = ~Got it right here. 'Netheril's Grimoire of Lost Arcana', just as you asked.~
@7305 = ~The Candlekeep scholars will no doubt be overjoyed to see their tome once more, though not before they part with a sizeable reward, naturally.~
@7306 = ~They sit upon a mountain of gold, those monks, offering a fortune for its return. Our coffers will swell significantly, a direct result of your skilled endeavors.~
@7307 = ~Your actions have solidified your worth to our guild, and this bounty you receive is but a fraction of the recognition you deserve. Use it with the cunning and discretion you've shown thus far.~
@7308 = ~As for what lies ahead, our joint ventures promise to shine even brighter, with such talent in our ranks.~
@7309 = ~You've arrived at an opportune moment. A new venture unfolds, one that demands your particular talents. Borland's grasp on his spice source has been... shall we say, loosened.~
@7310 = ~Through deft negotiation, we've rerouted a significant flow of black lotus directly to our doorsteps, bypassing Borland almost entirely. The quality, I assure you, is unparalleled.~
@7311 = ~Now, here's where you step in. A substantial shipment of this potent lotus needs to be transported, discreetly and securely, to the Lotus Tent at the Nashkel Carnival.~
@7312 = ~It's a delicate task, requiring both finesse and caution. The carnival, with its myriad eyes and ears, is no place for the heavy-handed. You must be as the whispering wind, quiet and unseen.~
@7313 = ~This operation, should you navigate it successfully, will not only flood our coffers but also cement our position as the premier purveyors of this exquisite rarity.~
@7314 = ~Do this right, and you'll have proven your worth tenfold in the shadows we tread.~
@7315 = ~Remember, the essence of our trade lies in the silent dance of shadows and secrets. Tread carefully, and let the carnival's cacophony be your cloak.~
@7316 = ~Considering our ongoing feud with the Shadow Thieves, isn't the carnival a risky place for such a trade?~
@7317 = ~Who will I be meeting, and how much gold should I be expecting for the transaction?~
@7318 = ~Smuggling lotus isn't my cup of tea. Do you have another job that might suit my skills better?~
@7319 = ~I'll make my way to the Nashkel Carnival and ensure the lotus reaches its destination.~
@7320 = ~Ah, you're right to be cautious, given our tussle with the Shadow Thieves. However, the winds of fortune blow favorably for us this time.~
@7321 = ~Lately, the Shadow Thieves have been uncharacteristically silent, almost as if they're lying low, which gives us a sliver of opportunity.~
@7322 = ~Furthermore, we still have Procus and his operation firmly rooted in the carnival. He's been our eyes and ears on that front and assures me that everything is running as smooth as silk.~
@7323 = ~The carnival, with its constant hustle and bustle, provides the perfect cover for our endeavor. It's a risky play, no doubt, but one well within our means to control.~
@7324 = ~Trust in Procus, trust in our preparation, and trust in the shadows that have always been our ally.~
@7325 = ~You'll be delivering a hefty sum of five pounds of the finest black lotus, each pound valued at a steep 600 gold. The quality of this lotus commands a high price on the market, and rightfully so.~
@7326 = ~Your contact at the carnival will be the proprietor of the Lotus Tent, a discreet fellow who knows how to handle such delicate trades. He'll be awaiting you inside.~
@7327 = ~Upon successful delivery, you'll be entitled to a 20% cut. It's a fair share for a job well done, and believe me, for this quality of lotus, buyers are more than willing to pay the asking price.~
@7328 = ~Ensure the transaction is smooth, and your reward will reflect the value of the goods you've safeguarded.~
@7329 = ~Very well, make for the Nashkel Carnival with due haste, but heed my words closely.~
@7330 = ~Avoid the main roads; the Flaming Fist has been unusually vigilant of late, patrolling with a keen eye for anything out of the ordinary.~
@7331 = ~Stick to the less-traveled paths, blend with the shadows, and move with the discretion we're known for.~
@7332 = ~Remember, you're not just carrying a commodity, you're transporting power, influence, and potential. It's not just the gold at stake but the reputation and future prospects of our guild.~
@7333 = ~And while the carnival's chaos is a boon, it can also be a bane. Keep your wits about you, not all there are mere merrymakers. Some eyes might see more than they should.~
@7334 = ~Trust in your skills, and let the cacophony of the carnival mask your true purpose. Return to us once the deed is done, and we shall reap the rewards of your success together.~
@7335 = ~Curious, I wasn't under the impression that the task was up for debate. However, I recognize that the lotus trade might not be to everyone's liking.~
@7336 = ~Given your standing in our guild and your proven capabilities, I'll grant you some leeway this time. But don't let this become a pattern, <CHARNAME>.~
@7337 = ~The ability to choose our paths is a luxury we seldom afford in our shadowed world. Now, onto another matter then.~
@7338 = ~We've got a situation with a client, Pruflas. He's been fogging his senses day in and day out at that very same lotus tent, to the point of oblivion.~
@7339 = ~His wife is desperate, offering a substantial reward for his safe return. That's where you step in.~
@7340 = ~Navigate your way to him, offer a guiding hand, and bring him back to the anxious arms of his spouse.~
@7341 = ~Succeed, and you'll earn a handsome cut of the reward. How does that sound for a change of pace?~
@7342 = ~I appreciate the alternative. Helping Pruflas seems more my style.~
@7343 = ~On second thought, I think I'd prefer the original task and ensure the black lotus reaches the Carnival.~
@7344 = ~Your fickleness is trying, <CHARNAME>. A decision made should be as steadfast as the shadows we dwell in.~
@7345 = ~However, since you've set your mind on the lotus delivery, see it through with unwavering resolve.~
@7346 = ~Fine, then. Pruflas it is. Just remember, this isn't about charity or goodwill; it's a job like any other, with its own gains and stakes.~
@7347 = ~Bring him back from his stupor, not necessarily for his well-being, but because it's profitable for us. Do this efficiently, and you'll get your due share.~
@7348 = ~Now off with you, and let's hope this diversion proves worthwhile for the guild.~
@7349 = ~Back from the shadows of Nashkel, are we? Tell me, has the task been seen to its end, or do we still dance around unfinished business?~
@7350 = ~Had a run in with the Flaming Fist and the Shadow Thieves, but I pulled through. Here's the loot.~
@7351 = ~The Flaming Fist got me on the road, had to give up a pound to see them off.~
@7352 = ~I was able to get Pruflas to return home to his wife.~
@7353 = ~Well, I kind of killed Pruflas by giving him too much black lotus.~
@7354 = ~Nothing new to report yet.~
@7355 = ~So, you managed to slip past the Flaming Fist and dodge the Shadow Thieves, delivering the goods without a hitch. Efficient, I'll give you that.~
@7356 = ~In our line of work, keeping a low profile is as good as gold, and you've done just that. Keep up this level of work, it's what keeps us afloat in these treacherous waters.~
@7357 = ~The total haul comes to 3000 gold, and from that, I'll carve out your twenty-percent. And for the extra effort, let's tack on another five percent. That puts 750 gold in your pocket.~
@7358 = ~Nice work out there, <CHARNAME>.~
@7359 = ~So, the Flaming Fist had you cornered, and you greased their palms with our product to slip away. It's a loss, yes, but the fact you walked away from their clutches is something else.~
@7360 = ~It's not often someone can outmaneuver the Fist, especially when they're breathing down your neck.~
@7361 = ~You've shown resourcefulness in a tight spot, <CHARNAME>, and that's worth something, even if it cost us.~
@7362 = ~Next time though, aim for a cleaner operation. Our coffers can't always afford such... creative solutions.~
@7363 = ~I'll hold onto the 2400 gold, and from that stash, I'll slice off your twenty-percent share. That leaves you with a neat sum of 480 gold. Fair's fair in our trade, <CHARNAME>.~
@7364 = ~The news has already reached my ears, along with a rather hefty sum from his doting wife. Quite a tidy amount, I must say.~
@7365 = ~Good work, <CHARNAME>. It's these kinds of results that bolster our standing and ensure our coffers are well-lined.~
@7366 = ~You did what? Killed Pruflas? I'm not interested in the messy details, <CHARNAME>. This isn't just a botched job, it's a blunder that's cost us dearly.~
@7367 = ~We lose not just the payment, but face a potential backlash. I expect a higher caliber of discretion and competence from those in our ranks.~
@7368 = ~Let this serve as a stark reminder that in our line of work, every action has its price, and it's high time you start weighing yours more carefully.~
@7369 = ~Ah, so you're at the helm now, are you? I must admit, the guild was running like a well-oiled machine until Baldwin lost his bearings.~
@7370 = ~If you can steer this ship with a firm hand, keep us on course, we might just weather this storm.~
@7371 = ~Remember, a leader in our line of work needs more than just ambition, it requires a shrewd mind and a keen eye for the shadows.~
@7372 = ~Do it right, and we'll be back to our profitable ways in no time.~
@7373 = ~Ah, the Guildmaster graces us with their presence. Our operations are running as smooth as silk under the cover of night, just as you'd like to hear.~
