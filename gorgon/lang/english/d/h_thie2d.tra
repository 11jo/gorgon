@52500 = ~Oi, blimey! Who the 'ell are you, then? Sneakin' up like a bleedin' shadow, you are!~
@52501 = ~Oh, wait a tick, you're one of us, ain't ya? Right, right. No harm, no foul, mate.~
@52502 = ~Well, it's just the way of the world, innit? You snooze, you lose. I got here first, I did, and this shiny bauble is already spoken for. Finders keepers, as they say on the streets.~
@52503 = ~Ain't personal, you know. Just business. One thief to another, you understand, right? We're both just tryin' to make our way in this dog-eat-dog world. No need for any rough stuff.~
@52504 = ~Who are you? Are you with the Gorgon's Eye?~
@52505 = ~Nice try, but that necklace isn't yours to take. Hand it over, mate. I'm not here to banter.~
@52506 = ~The bloody Gorgon's Eye, he says. You're havin' a laugh, ain't ya? Nah mate, I ain't part of those mugs. I answer to Blackthorn. He's the real brains in this business.~
@52507 = ~Hand it over, eh? You've got some nerve. But look, I'm no fool. This trinket is my ticket, not yours. Blackthorn's counting on this one.~
@52508 = ~Now, how about you trot along, and we forget this little standoff, yeah?~
@52509 = ~Seems like talking's off the table. Guess we do this the old-fashioned way.~
@52510 = ~I'm not going to ask again. Hand over that necklace.~
@52511 = ~Old-fashioned suits me just fine. Let's dance then, shall we?~
@52512 = ~And I won't say it again. This beauty's staying with me. Looks like we're doing this the hard way.~
