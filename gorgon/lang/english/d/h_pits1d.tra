@50000 = ~Peace be with you, traveler.~
@50001 = ~In the midst of the fray, there lies a certain stillness, a centering force. Can you feel it too?~
@50002 = ~I've experienced it. It's as if time slows, and clarity emerges from chaos. What do you believe is the source of this, 'stillness'?~
@50003 = ~I'm interested in learning more about you. Is there anything you can tell me about yourself?~
@50004 = ~Why do you fight in the pits, Khalid?~
@50005 = ~I'll be going now.~

@50014 = ~In the heat of battle, amidst the clash of steel and the surge of adrenaline, you will find the true essence of Ki.~
@50015 = ~The fighting pits, my friend, offer an unparalleled opportunity to hone this energy. Through every strike, every parry, and every breath, you will draw closer to understanding.~
@50016 = ~It is in the crucible of combat that the secrets of Ki reveal themselves, and there, you shall find your path.~
@50017 = ~I hail from Damara, a land scarred by the relentless tides of conflict. In my youth, Withermeet, my village, nestled within the Bloodstone Lands, faced its share of trials.~
@50018 = ~It was a place of humble lives, bound by the bonds of community. Yet, fate dealt us a cruel hand.~
@50019 = ~Mercenaries, driven by greed and malice, descended upon us, leaving naught but ruin and ash in their wake. My parents, stalwart defenders of our home, fell valiantly in the face of darkness.~

@50028 = ~I find a reflection of my journey, a mirror to my past, and a glimpse into my future. It's a path of growth, of understanding, and perhaps, even redemption.~
@50029 = ~Good luck in your trials, and may you find strength in every challenge you face.~
@50030 = ~Well fought, my friend. Your skill and determination are evident. You've proven yourself a force to be reckoned with in these pits.~

@50036 = ~I observed your bout with Lyria. Her agility and trickery proved challenging. A good warrior knows how to adapt and learn from each match. It will serve you well in the pits.~
@50037 = ~Impressive, indeed. Serra is no easy opponent. Her skill with the bow is something to be admired.~
@50038 = ~By the gods, you've done it! You bested Roran, the reigning champion! Your mastery over ki is truly something to behold. You've certainly earned your place among the best in the pits.~
@50039 = ~Isla's return... It troubles my heart. I believe all life is sacred, and such fights go against the teachings I hold dear.~
@50040 = ~You must approach this with wisdom and caution, my friend. May you find a way to resolve this without unnecessary loss.~
@50041 = ~I cannot condone the taking of a life, even in the heat of battle. It saddens me to see such an end, but I understand that the pits have their own way of settling disputes.~
@50042 = ~Your skill is undeniable, and it is clear you possess a strength that cannot be ignored.~
