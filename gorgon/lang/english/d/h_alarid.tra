@9000 = ~Ah, an unexpected visitor! How intriguing! What brings you to my abode? Are you here to witness the wonders of my concoctions? Or perhaps you seek something else entirely?~
@9001 = ~The mysteries of alchemy are boundless, you know! Boundless, I tell you! So, speak up, my friend, and let us unravel the secrets that dance in the eldritch vapors!~
@9002 = ~I'm here to ensure your serum reaches those in need. The suffering caused by featherlung is far too great to ignore.~
@9003 = ~I've come to discuss a business proposition. Your featherlung serum could fetch a handsome price in the right hands.~
@9004 = ~(Snap his neck.)~
@9005 = ~Featherlung? Featherlung! Blast it all! That was never my intention! I toil day and night, seeking to perfect a potion for poultry, not play savior to a city plagued by disease!~
@9006 = ~These chickens... these cursed, chaotic creatures! They multiply, but they've become nigh uncontrollable!~
@9007 = ~And yet, here you stand, prattling on about featherlung, as if it were my life's calling! Bah! I couldn't care less about that blasted ailment!~
@9008 = ~This serum could change lives, but you're letting your obsession blind you to reason!~
@9009 = ~Could you at least spare a small sample? The healers might be able to study it, perhaps replicate it for wider use.~
@9010 = ~I fear there's a bounty on your head for this serum. If you don't hand it over, I'll be forced to collect it myself.~
@9011 = ~No! No, no, no! It's mine, you hear? My creation! The culmination of my brilliance, my toil, my genius! I won't have it dissected and duplicated like some common formula!~
@9012 = ~It's mine to control, mine to decide its fate! I won't let them take it from me, not now, not ever!~
@9013 = ~I've tried to be patient, but lives are at stake. Give me a sample, or I'll take it myself!~
@9014 = ~If the healers can study the serum, there's a greater chance someone will crack the code to your perfect chicken formula. It's a win-win.~
@9015 = ~I've had enough of this, Alaric. Time to make your peace. (Snap his neck.)~
@9016 = ~These are inconsequential trifles compared to the brilliance that stands before you! I will not be swayed by your feeble attempts at reason.~
@9017 = ~The serum is mine, and mine alone! Its destiny rests in my hands, and I will see it through, consequences be damned!~
