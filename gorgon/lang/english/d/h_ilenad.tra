@38000 = ~Oh, hi there! Can't say I've seen your face around here before. It's always a pleasure to meet someone new, especially in our cozy little hideaway.~
@38001 = ~My name's Ilena, and I have... let's call it, a special touch for helping people unwind and feel right at home.~
@38002 = ~Whether it's a friendly chat or a bit more... private attention, I'm here to make you feel as comfortable as I can.~
@38003 = ~And just so you know, my lips are sealed... except when they're not. I'm good at keeping secrets, and our moments together will stay between us, a hidden world that only we will know.~
@38004 = ~So, are you curious about the little wonders we could explore together? Believe me, I have ways of making your time here feel like a dream you won't want to wake from.~
@38005 = ~I'm actually here to discuss the situation between Amrius and Aisha. There's a lot of talk about what happened, and your name came up.~
@38006 = ~Let's sit down for a while and talk. I'm always up for a good conversation.~
@38007 = ~I'm interested in spending some... private time together.~
@38008 = ~As much as I'd like to stay, I have some things I need to take care of.~
@38009 = ~<CHARNAME>, my favorite visitor. I must be doing something right for you to find your way back to me. So, what brings you to my little corner of the world today?~
@38010 = ~Oh, I'm so glad you said that! There's something uniquely enticing about a deep, meaningful conversation, isn't there?~
@38011 = ~Please, go speak with Madam Meredia to set things up. She'll ensure everything is just perfect for us.~
@38012 = ~I'll be waiting, thinking about all the delightful possibilities our talk might bring. See you soon, then!~
@38013 = ~Your interest flatters me. I assure you, spending private time together will be an experience you'll find deeply gratifying.~
@38014 = ~There's a whole world of pleasure and sensation I'm eager to introduce you to. In fact, I'm already tingling at the thought of revealing my... special ways of bringing you joy.~
@38015 = ~Please, arrange the details with Madam Meredia. She'll ensure we have the perfect setting for our encounter. The wait will be worth it, I promise.~
@38016 = ~Such a shame you have to leave. I had already started imagining all the delightful ways we could have spent our time together. It's a real tease, isn't it?~
@38017 = ~But I understand, responsibilities must be tended to. Just know, when you return, I'll be here, eagerly waiting to turn those fantasies into reality.~
@38018 = ~Imagine the possibilities, the whispers, the caresses... Let that thought keep you company until you're back. Don't keep me waiting too long, ok, darling?~
@38019 = ~It was lovely spending time with you. Don't be a stranger, okay? I'll always be here for a chat or just to share a moment. Come back and visit me soon!~
@38020 = ~Oh, not this again. What have they gotten themselves into now? It's like they can't go a day without some new melodrama. Every time I turn around, there's another saga brewing with those two.~
@38021 = ~Believe it or not, Amrius has gone as far as putting a bounty on her after what happened the other night.~
@38022 = ~It's quite a mess, he's put a hit out on Aisha after their altercation at the Burning Wizard.~
@38023 = ~This time it's serious. Amrius has placed a bounty on Aisha's head. Apparently, there was a major blowup between them at the tavern.~
@38024 = ~You know, I might have been the only sober one there that night. It's a wild tale, but here's the truth.~
@38025 = ~Amrius hired me specifically to ruffle Aisha's feathers. He knew she was at the Burning Wizard and wanted to make her jealous... classic Amrius move. And it worked.~
@38026 = ~Aisha just lost it when she saw us together. She flew at him like a banshee, gave him a good thrashing, right there in the tavern. It was quite the scene.~
@38027 = ~But wanting her dead? That's a bit extreme, even for Amrius. Here's the thing though, both of them, they're a bit... well, unhinged.~
@38028 = ~Aisha and Amrius, they're like fire and oil. They set each other off in the worst ways. It's like they have these dual sides to them.~
@38029 = ~One minute they're fine, the next, it's as if someone else takes over, someone with no control, no predictability. It's not just mood swings, it's like they're completely different people at times.~
@38030 = ~You might say they're perfectly disastrous for each other. One moment, it's passionate love, the next, it's all-out war. Their emotions, their behaviors, you never know what you're going to get.~
@38031 = ~It's why they're drawn to each other, and why they're so toxic. So, while the bounty is shocking, in a twisted way, it's just another chapter in their chaotic story.~
@38032 = ~Since you seem to have some influence over Amrius, do you think you could persuade him to drop the bounty?~
@38033 = ~This whole saga is turning into a farce. I'm thinking it might be easier just to collect the bounty on Aisha and be done with it.~
@38034 = ~You know Amrius and Aisha better than most. What's your advice on how I should handle this situation?~
@38035 = ~Well, it's a tricky situation, isn't it? On one hand, Aisha certainly doesn't deserve to die over a tavern scuffle and a fit of jealousy. That's extreme, even considering their volatile history.~
@38036 = ~But on the other hand, it's not really my place to meddle in guild business, especially when it comes to matters as serious as bounties. I've learned it's best to keep a bit of distance in these things.~
@38037 = ~I'd say the decision ultimately lies with you. You're the one tasked with this, after all. It's a tough call, but you'll need to weigh the consequences and make the choice that seems right to you.~
@38038 = ~That's... well, it's certainly a decision. I won't pretend to understand all the reasons behind it, nor is it my place to judge. It's just a bit sad, isn't it? How things turn out sometimes.~
@38039 = ~But if that's what you've decided, then I suppose there's not much more to say.~
@38040 = ~You want me to talk to Amrius about dropping the bounty? That's... well, it's not usually my place to get involved in these affairs, but I can see this situation is spiraling out of control.~
@38041 = ~Alright, I'll do it. I have some free time later tonight, and I can meet with him. I can't promise anything, but I'll see if there's a way to convince him to let this go.~
@38042 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! It's such a relief to see you!~
@38043 = ~His wife returned unexpectedly and discovered us together! I was forced to witness the terrible events that followed.~
@38044 = ~I made an attempt to flee, but he overpowered me and knocked me out. When I awoke, we were on the road, heading south. I was so scared. I didn't know what he was going to do with me!~
@38045 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You truly are my savior! I don't know how I can ever repay you.~
@38046 = ~I'll be making my way back to the den now. I'm sure Meredia must have been beside herself with worry over my absence.~
