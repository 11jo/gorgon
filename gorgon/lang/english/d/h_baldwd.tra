@12000 = ~I think you've stumbled into the wrong place, friend. I'm certain there's a cat ensnared in the branches outside, desperate for your gallant rescue. Now, begone from me. The stench of your sanctimonious bullshit disgusts me.~
@12001 = ~Only a fool would dare to tread so boldly into my lair. Tradition and prudence both dictate a swift end for such intrusion.~
@12002 = ~Your face, however... is not unknown to me. <CHARNAME>, if my sources serve me right?~
@12003 = ~Another assassin then? You're not the first to threaten my life only to forfeit their own.~
@12004 = ~How did you come by my name? Who are you?~
@12005 = ~<CHARNAME>? Can't say it rings a bell. But now that pleasantries are out of the way, I think it's time I took my leave.~
@12006 = ~Let's not resort to hostilities so quickly. Sheathe your weapons, you're not in the presence of your enemy. At least, not yet.~
@12007 = ~In my line of work, knowledge is as valuable as gold, and I ensure I am rich in both.~
@12008 = ~I am Baldwin, master of the Gorgon's Eye, a name I trust you've heard whispered in shadowed corners.~
@12009 = ~Do not be deceived by the modesty of this setting, however. While it may lack grandeur, it is merely the facade of a far-reaching network.~
@12010 = ~Our resources are vast, our influence pervasive, stretching across all quarters south of the Gate.~
@12011 = ~Now, onto the matter at hand. Your head has a price, a rather hefty sum, I must say. Surrounded as you are by my most skilled hunters, it would be effortless to claim that bounty.~
@12012 = ~I could have you killed at the lift of my finger, collect my reward, and think nothing of it. However, your particular set of skills are rare, and I dare say, more valuable to me alive than dead.~
@12013 = ~Rather than sealing your fate here and now, I present you with a rare opportunity. Consider this an invitation to join the Gorgon's Eye.~
@12014 = ~Should your ambitions crave more than mere survival, and your pockets yearn for the weight of gold, then our paths may align most fortuitously.~
@12015 = ~We value skills such as yours, and in return, offer rewards most others can only dream of.~
@12016 = ~Considering Ravenscar's grip on the north and the Shadow Thieves presence in Amn, how do you manage to navigate your position amidst such hostile rivalries?~
@12017 = ~What's in it for me if I decide to align with your guild?~
@12018 = ~What would be the typical undertakings for someone in my position within the guild?~
@12019 = ~What about the City Watch? Does their presence here pose a threat to the Gorgon's Eye?~
@12020 = ~I accept your offer and look forward to the opportunities it will provide.~
@12021 = ~While I'm not one to easily trust, I'm willing to take a chance on this alliance.~
@12022 = ~My pursuits lie beyond the realm of stealth and subterfuge. Petty thievery, even at its most sophisticated, doesn't align with my path.~
@12023 = ~Oh my, quite a surprise that you would be so well-informed. A refreshing contrast to the usual drab I am forced to deal with, and I'll admit, it's a trait I admire.~
@12024 = ~Ravenscar's influence does leave the walls, to be sure. Yet, his reach is not limitless, and his jurisdiction stays within.~
@12025 = ~As for Linvail and his dogs, their gaze seldom wanders this far north. Here in Beregost, under the nose of such intrigue, I've carved out a domain for the Gorgon's Eye.~
@12026 = ~Let me assure you, our position is not one of vulnerability but of strategic advantage. We operate in the blind spots of these behemoths, exploiting opportunities they overlook.~
@12027 = ~In time, their oversight will be their undoing, and we shall be ready to capitalize. Aligning with us means being part of a vision that extends beyond mere survival, it's about ascendancy.~
@12028 = ~We are not mere pawns in their game, we are players in our own right, set to turn the tides when they least expect it.~
@12029 = ~The offer I lay before you is one veiled in shadows, a path tread by few. You shall not merely join us, you will transcend into the very essence of stealth and subterfuge.~
@12030 = ~The masters of shadow within our fold are not just thieves or spies, they are artists of the unseen, sculptors of darkness.~
@12031 = ~Under their guidance, you will learn secrets that lurk beneath the surface of Faerun, arts that manipulate the very fabric of secrecy and silence.~
@12032 = ~Armed with knowledge that has been secreted through the ages, tools that whisper death, and magics that dance on the edge of darkness, you will become a phantom that the world barely perceives, yet fears.~
@12033 = ~And as for your share of our endeavors, they will surely extend beyond the mere acquisition of gold.~
@12034 = ~We delve into ancient mysteries, acquire artifacts shrouded in oblivion, and weave influence that extends like tendrils through the veins of power across the Sword Coast.~
@12035 = ~In the Gorgon's Eye, you will find not just allies, but shadows that stand with you in the darkest of times.~
@12036 = ~We are a brotherhood that moves in silence, bound by secrets and the unbreakable oath of the unseen.~
@12037 = ~Consider my offer as a passage into a world where the line between shadow and reality blurs, a realm where every whispered secret can be yours to wield.~
@12038 = ~In the ranks of the Gorgon's Eye, you will be plunged into a world of multifaceted and intricate shadowplay, where your activities will span the full gamut of the covert arts.~
@12039 = ~You'll engage in the classic trades of our craft; pickpocketing, lockpicking, intelligence gathering, and facilitating contracts in regards to more... permanent solutions.~
@12040 = ~But our aspirations go beyond mere burglary. You'll learn the delicate art of infiltration, slipping past guards like a whisper in the night, breaching vaults thought impregnable.~
@12041 = ~You will be the unseen agent in high-stakes heists, where the prize is not just wealth, but secrets and artifacts of immense power.~
@12042 = ~Our missions may often require you to blend with the shadows, undetectable, as you navigate through labyrinths of danger and deception.~
@12043 = ~Yet, at times, a bolder touch is called for. A rapid, decisive strike that leaves our targets reeling before they even realize what they've lost.~
@12044 = ~In our world, each stolen item holds a story, each pilfered secret can alter the course of destinies.~
@12045 = ~Here, thievery is not just a means to wealth, it's a conduit to power, a play in the grand game that unfolds in the unseen corners of the Sword Coast.~
@12046 = ~Ah, the City Watch, yes, their shadows have grown longer on our streets. But fear not, for they are but a minor nuisance to our grander designs.~
@12047 = ~We've always thrived under the gaze of such obstacles. Their patrols, their attempts at law enforcement, they are predictable, and predictability can be exploited.~
@12048 = ~We've adapted our operations to be even more elusive, more subtle. They're looking for shadows in a town we've blanketed in darkness.~
@12049 = ~The Gorgon's Eye is not just a guild, it's an idea, a whisper that moves unseen and untouched. So, let them have their patrols. Let them believe they're regaining control.~
@12050 = ~It only makes our victories sweeter, our successes more poignant. In the end, they're but pieces in a game they scarcely understand, and we, my friend, are always two steps ahead.~
@12051 = ~Ah, the art of feigning ignorance. A classic move, yet transparent in this case. I admire the attempt at subterfuge, truly, but let's not play games that we both know the end of.~
@12052 = ~You're in the viper's nest, and while I can appreciate your cunning, I cannot vouch for your safety among my less discerning associates.~
@12053 = ~It would be wise to make your exit swiftly, lest you find out how unforgiving the Gorgon's Eye can be to uninvited guests.~
@12054 = ~Our endeavors here stretch far beyond the bounds of what one might call 'petty thievery.'~
@12055 = ~So be it. We don't lack for capable hands, and I doubt you'll find many in Beregost with offers as generous as mine.~
@12056 = ~Just remember, when the streets turn cold and allies scarce, don't come looking for warmth in shadows you once scorned.~
@12057 = ~You tread dangerous ground returning here, after spurning the Gorgon's Eye. This is no sanctuary for the unaligned, and you, my friend, have just stripped yourself of our protection.~
@12058 = ~Be wise, make your next steps carefully, for you're in the heart of a den that no longer regards you as a friend. I suggest you leave, and quickly.~
@12059 = ~The goodwill of the Gorgon's Eye is not easily regained, and its wrath, even less so.~
@12060 = ~Excellent. Welcome to the shadows of the Gorgon's Eye. Familiarize yourself with our ways, but don't get too comfortable. Comfort breeds complacency, and that is something we cannot afford.~
@12061 = ~Rigaldo will be your guide through the initial trials. He has a series of tasks designed to test your mettle, to see if you truly possess the cunning and skill that our guild demands.~
@12062 = ~Consider these tasks as your rite of passage, the crucible through which you must pass to be forged into one of us.~
@12063 = ~Remember, you stand on the threshold of a world where every whisper could be a dagger, every shadow a sanctuary.~
@12064 = ~Perform well, and you will earn your place among our ranks, a true member of the Gorgon's Eye, entrusted with secrets that many will never know.~
@12065 = ~I have pressing matters that demand my attention, so I'll leave you in Rigaldo's capable hands. Prove yourself, and let your actions reflect the stealth and guile that define us.~
@12066 = ~Small talk won't serve you here. Attend to your duties and fulfill your role.~
@12067 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Just the person I wanted to see. Rigaldo speaks highly of your skills, and envisions a promising future for you within the guild.~
@12068 = ~You're an official member of the Gorgon's Eye now. There's a lot more work ahead, but I have full confidence in your abilities.~
@12069 = ~Now, for the task at hand. I'm entrusting you with highly classified guild business, so pay close attention.~
@12070 = ~Under my command, I have a black-ops unit of exceptionally skilled spies and shadows, referred to as my Snake Heads.~
@12071 = ~They have been assigned the task of investigating the whereabouts of an extremely powerful and ancient artifact, the Kerykeion.~
@12072 = ~We believe it made its way to Faerun during the Time of Troubles, but was detroyed shortly after and seperated into three fragments.~
@12073 = ~Now, our objective is to collect these fragments and reconstruct the staff in working order, which our seasoned alchemists have already devised a method to accomplish.~
@12074 = ~Our latest intel points to a dark socerer, perched high atop the Gibberling Mountains, to carry a shard in her possession. I want you to retrieve it.~
@12075 = ~This will be a demanding campaign, requiring considerable efforts on all fronts. I trust that you're up for the challenge.~
@12076 = ~What can you tell me about the Kerykeion?~
@12077 = ~How does one become a Snake Head?~
@12078 = ~Where are the Gibberling Mountains located?~
@12079 = ~I'll return when I have the shard.~
@12080 = ~The Kerykeion is a magical staff of unprecedented power, forged in the endless depths of the underworld by a team of serpentine demi-gods, the Gorgon Sisters.~
@12081 = ~The feeble minds of most historians have dismissed it as mere legend, their lack of curiosity a glaring testament to their ignorance.~
@12082 = ~Yet, within the echelons of our profession, we know better. We understand the dark allure that dwells within the heart of such mysteries.~
@12083 = ~The artifact exists, each shard containing the essence of a different sister, silently waiting for their return.~
@12084 = ~Becoming a Snake Head requires more than just skill. You need to possess an instinct for the shadows, an innate ability to blend seamlessly into any environment.~
@12085 = ~You must be able to think on your feet, adapt to unforeseen circumstances, and above all, maintain absolute discretion.~
@12086 = ~It's not a path for the faint of heart, but those who prove themselves earn the privilege.~
@12087 = ~You can find them far to the southeast, overlooking the entrance to the mines of Nashkel.~
@12088 = ~I knew I could count on you. Locate the dark witch and retrieve the artifact, whatever the cost.~
@12089 = ~If you so desire, Saradin is a meticulous chronicler on matters of the Kerykeion, seek him out for further queries.~
@12090 = ~This mission carries significant weight, <CHARNAME>. Failure is not an option.~
@12091 = ~The shard of the Kerykeion, here, within our grasp. Even as you approach, the very air seems to thrum with its ancient aura. Hand it over, quickly now.~
@12092 = ~Ah, the moment I've dreamt of since I was but a boy listening to tales in the dark. Gaze upon it, <CHARNAME>. Can you feel the surge of its power, the persistent pull of its promise?~
@12093 = ~Even in its fractured state, it speaks of dominion, of a power so vast, so intoxicating, it's almost unbearable.~
@12094 = ~This is but a mere fragment of its full glory, a tantalizing glimpse into the vast supremacy that awaits us.~
@12095 = ~I must know everything, every detail of your encounter. Spare no words, for this is a tale that will be etched into the very soul of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@12096 = ~Your feat is not just a victory, it's a stepping stone to a future where we wield power the likes of which this world has never seen.~
@12097 = ~The sorcerer appeared unstable, a shadow of herself, as if consumed by Kerykeion's influence.~
@12098 = ~She spoke of other rogues who assailed her for the Kerykeion, drawn to its power like moths to a flame.~
@12099 = ~As the conflict erupted, she wielded the artifact's power to conjure serpents from thin air, as if bending the very essence of the Kerykeion to her will.~
@12100 = ~While the details of my journey are many, perhaps we should focus on the immediate implications. The shard is ours, but it's clear we're not alone in this hunt.~
@12101 = ~The Kerykeion is indeed a formidable artifact, not just in its power but in the immense mental resilience it demands from its wielder.~
@12102 = ~It's a common folly to underestimate the toll such artifacts can exact on the psyche.~
@12103 = ~To harness its full potential, one must possess not only magical proficiency but also an unyielding mental fortitude to safeguard against the encroaching shadows it can cast upon the mind.~
@12104 = ~It seems, in this case, the mage lacked the inner strength necessary to withstand its influence, becoming a victim to its overwhelming force rather than its master.~
@12105 = ~Such is the fate of those who seek power without understanding the price it demands.~
@12106 = ~The mission's details have been fully disclosed, Baldwin. My report is concluded.~
@12107 = ~This development is indeed most intriguing and concerning. The fact that other rogues were involved and aware of her possession of the Kerykeion suggests a breach in our information security.~
@12108 = ~It raises several unsettling questions: Who else knows of our operations, and how did they come by this information? Moreover, the intent of these rogues remains unclear.~
@12109 = ~Were they merely opportunists drawn by the lure of the Kerykeion, or is there a deeper, more organized scheme at play?~
@12110 = ~This incident, I fear, is just the surface of a much larger and complex web we have yet to uncover.~
@12111 = ~We must proceed with heightened vigilance and caution, for our path has become more treacherous with these unknown players in the shadows.~
@12112 = ~Indeed, that is a remarkable display of power. Your account aligns perfectly with the legends surrounding the Kerykeion.~
@12113 = ~The ability to command serpents is said to be a direct gift from the Gorgon Sisters, a manifestation of their will and essence.~
@12114 = ~This 'Gorgon's offspring' ability, as it is known, is extremely rare and potent. It signifies a deep and intrinsic connection to the artifact and, by extension, to the Gorgon Sisters themselves.~
@12115 = ~This mage, despite her instability, must have been in profound, albeit dangerous, communion with the Kerykeion to wield such extraordinary power.~
@12116 = ~It's both a fascinating and ominous revelation; the capabilities of the Kerykeion are exactly as profound and mystical as I expected.~
@12117 = ~We must tread carefully, as we push deeper into the realm of powers that are ancient and, by their very nature, unpredictable and perilous.~
@12118 = ~Listen carefully. I have sensed a presence here of late, a stirring in the shadows not of our making. Eyes in the city, alien and unwelcomed.~
@12119 = ~It has become evident that we are under scrutiny. An attempt to uncover our knowledge of the Kerykeion, perhaps. I will have my spies investigate this matter more thoroughly.~
@12120 = ~Attend to your regular duties, but excerise caution in your movements, especially within the city. Eye every shadow, and question every face.~
@12121 = ~That is all I need for now, you are dismissed. I will summon you if needed.~
@12122 = ~<CHARNAME>! Ascend to the surface and eliminate all the Shadow Thieves from the city.~
@12123 = ~I've found these reports among the dead, but I'm unable to decipher their contents.~
@12124 = ~Understood.~
@12125 = ~Let me see those documents! Their code is like an old language to me.~
@12126 = ~...Incredible.~
@12127 = ~Belay those orders! The attack was a feint! It was nothing but a diversion, a ploy to draw our eyes while they enact their true plan.~
@12128 = ~Their main force isn't lingering here, Thamuz is leading them north, destined for the Wood of Sharp Teeth.~
@12129 = ~They plan negotiations with a cadre of smugglers for the acquisition of a Kerykeion piece! Damn those sons of bitches! They've been one step ahead of us at every turn!~
@12130 = ~<CHARNAME>, head north immediately. Avoid all confrontation. With haste, you might reach the smugglers before their main battalion arrives.~
@12131 = ~If this report is to be believed, their contact 'Nagate' will be stationed by some ancient elven ruins. That is where the exchange will take place.~
@12132 = ~Ariosh mentioned Thamuz leads their offensive. Given your past with the Shadow Thieves, do you have any insight on him?~
@12133 = ~The Shadow Thieves are cunning, could this not be a trap designed to lure us in?~
@12134 = ~I'll head out now, swift and silent.~
@12135 = ~Thamuz, a name drenched in shadows and blood from our past. Among the Shadow Thieves, he was a figure of dark renown, a mastermind of the night, skilled in the art of silent death.~
@12136 = ~Yes, I remember him well. Cold, calculating, a strategist with a mind as sharp as the daggers he favored. His heists were works of complete deception, leaving no trace but fear in their wake.~
@12137 = ~When I severed my ties with the Shadow Thieves, Thamuz saw it as the ultimate betrayal. To him, it was more than a departure, it was an open challenge, a defiance of the order he so rigidly enforced.~
@12138 = ~His leadership of their battalion now, is no mere coincidence. Thamuz is not just after the Kerykeion, he seeks to assert dominance, to redraw the lines of power.~
@12139 = ~Make no mistake, <CHARNAME>, confronting Thamuz is to face one of the most formidable adversaries from the darkest corners of my past.~
@12140 = ~Make haste, time is of the essence.~
@12141 = ~Your caution is well-placed, <CHARNAME>, and underestimating Thamuz would be a fool's errand. The risk of a trap is as real as the shadows we blend into.~
@12142 = ~However, the mere whisper of the Kerykeion, makes this a gambit we cannot ignore. We tread on a path of uncertainty, but also one that could lead us to untold power.~
@12143 = ~In our world, every shadow could be a trap, every ally a potential adversary. It's the price we pay for dealing in secrets and power.~
@12144 = ~Go with the stealth of night and the cunning of the serpent. Let the shadows be your ally, and if it is a snare, let it spring. For in the heart of danger lies the seed of opportunity.~
@12145 = ~Every moment lost strengthens Thamuz's hand. Move swiftly, and let action be your reply.~
@12146 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, the winds whisper of your recent exploits. Thamuz bested, and the Kerykeion shard in your possession. Such accomplishments are noteworthy, even by our standards.~
@12147 = ~Present the shard to me. Its acquisition is a significant stride in our endeavors, yet the context of its capture, the interplay of wits and wills, that's where true insight lies.~
@12148 = ~I am compelled to inquire about the nuances of your encounter with Thamuz. He was a man known for veiling truths in shadows. What transpired in those decisive moments, I wonder.~
@12149 = ~Thamuz shared a dire warning about the Kerykeion. He claimed it's a force of chaos, and that your ambition to unite it will bring calamity upon Faerun.~
@12150 = ~I learned the attack on Beregost wasn't just their initiative. Someone else, with deep pockets, hired them specifically to weaken our position.~
@12151 = ~The Kerykeion's power is clear, yet its purpose in your hands remains a mystery. What exactly do you intend to achieve?~
@12152 = ~Beyond the battle and obtaining the shard, there was nothing notable to report.~
@12153 = ~Thamuz, always the puppet-master, weaving his webs of deceit. A formidable skill he has mastered over the years.~
@12154 = ~Consider the possibility that he aimed to sow seeds of distrust between us, especially if his attempt to eliminate you had failed.~
@12155 = ~As for the Kerykeion, my dedication to its study spans a lifetime. I am intimately aware of both its perils and its promise.~
@12156 = ~My research, my understanding of its arcane intricacies, surpasses what most can fathom. The power it holds is not only controllable but can be wielded to achieve dominion.~
@12157 = ~Do not doubt, <CHARNAME>, the fate of the Kerykeion is safe in my hands. We stand on the cusp of realizing a vision that will redefine our existence.~
@12158 = ~Intriguing, indeed. The revelation that an external entity has financed the Shadow Thieves against us suggests a deeper game at play.~
@12159 = ~Who could harbor such animosity or fear towards our ascendancy? This warrants thorough investigation. We must unravel this web of intrigue and expose the architect of this covert aggression.~
@12160 = ~I will mobilize our network of spies to delve into the shadows, to extract information from the unseen corners of Beregost and beyond.~
@12161 = ~We cannot allow such bold moves against the Gorgon's Eye to go unchecked. Whoever is behind this, they've made a critical error in underestimating the reach and resourcefulness of our guild.~
@12162 = ~In the light of our open conflict with the Shadow Thieves, subtlety in my intentions serves little purpose now.~
@12163 = ~The Kerykeion, a relic I have coveted since youth, whispered to me through my brother Richard's tales, is more than a mere token of retribution.~
@12164 = ~It is the cornerstone of a grand design, one conceived in the shadows of a forsaken past.~
@12165 = ~My plan transcends a simple vendetta. It is about reshaping the very essence of power. To dismantle the Shadow Thieves, to eradicate their leadership, is only but the first step.~
@12166 = ~What follows is the consolidation of their remnants under our dominion, the Gorgon's Eye emerging not merely as victors but as sovereigns of the underworld.~
@12167 = ~The Kerykeion's power is not to be feared, but wielded with precision. My years within the Shadow Thieves has honed a meticulousness that will ensure our ascendancy.~
@12168 = ~We stand on the brink of a new epoch, an era where shadows bend to our will, and the Gorgon's Eye casts its gaze upon a world ripe for our reign.~
@12169 = ~Your role in these grand schemes, however, does not pause here. Be prepared to receive further orders concerning the Kerykeion and our ongoing strife with the Shadow Thieves.~
@12170 = ~Until such time, you are to return to your standard duties within the guild. In your absence, a surge of activity has unfolded.~
@12171 = ~Bounties have been issued, contracts drawn, and fresh intelligence on the City Watch has emerged. It seems there's a rising tide of unrest, one that we must swiftly address.~
@12172 = ~Moreover, a certain agitation has gripped our courtesans, stirring the undercurrents of our operations. I trust you to quell this commotion and manage the situation with your usual efficacy.~
@12173 = ~For now, you are dismissed. Attend to these matters, and await my summons. The path we tread is complex, but with your aid, our ascendancy is inevitable.~
@12174 = ~I was given this missive by one of your Snake Heads, before he succumbed to his injuries.~
@12175 = ~Hand it over, immediately! The dying act of a Snake Head is never without significance.~
@12176 = ~Ah, this... this is treachery most foul!~
@12177 = ~Beregost, the city of cowards, and their Lord of Piss-all, Gerard Travenhurst, daring to defy me?~
@12178 = ~Betraying us to the Shadow Thieves, and offering the final shard of the Kerykeion as recompense!~
@12179 = ~This man, who once groveled at our doorstep, seeking favors, now dares to challenge the might of the Gorgon's Eye.~
@12180 = ~No honor, no loyalty. These are treacherous times, <CHARNAME>, and they demand a reckoning.~
@12181 = ~We must act swiftly. The time for subtlety has passed. We will confront this traitor in his own lair, his opulent manor, which will soon witness his downfall.~
@12182 = ~I shall personally see to it that Gerard Travenhurst answers for his betrayal. He will learn the cost of crossing paths with the Gorgon's Eye.~
@12183 = ~It's clear Gerard has chosen his path. He'll face the consequences of his actions soon enough.~
@12184 = ~We shouldn't underestimate him. It's possible we're being led into a trap.~
@12185 = ~Regardless of Gerard's actions, we should prioritize retrieving the Kerykeion shard.~
@12186 = ~Well said, <CHARNAME>. Justice will be swift, and Gerard shall pay the price for his betrayal.~
@12187 = ~Then I shall disarm it. The Kerykeion will be mine, and with it, I will obliterate all those who stand in my way.~
@12188 = ~Yes. The Kerykeion is our key to power and leverage, and with it, we shall impart a lesson they won't soon forget.~
@12189 = ~Prepare yourself, <CHARNAME>. This confrontation will be the culmination of all that we have strived for.~
@12190 = ~Gerard's folly will serve as a message to all who dare defy us. The Kerykeion will be ours, and with it, the dawn of a new era under our dominion.~
@12191 = ~You'll be pleased to hear that I've come across the last piece of the Kerykeion. Success is ours, Baldwin.~
@12192 = ~You, what? How is that possible! Speak, quickly!~
@12193 = ~I retrieved it from a black market auction in the Baldur's Gate Undercellars. It was being sold off as a mere historical artifact, but I recognized its true value.~
@12194 = ~I had a run-in with a Shadow Thief named Quass. The confrontation was unavoidable and ended with his demise. The shard was among his possessions.~
@12195 = ~In the depths of the Firewine Ruins, among ancient relics and spirits, I found the shard concealed within a forgotten chamber.~
@12196 = ~Deep in the Cloakwood Forest, hidden beneath an ancient tree, I discovered the artifact, likely left by the druids, fearful of its power.~
@12197 = ~Present the shard to me. Let's see this fortuitous piece you've uncovered.~
@12198 = ~It's almost poetic, isn't it? How destiny weaves its intricate web, guiding you to my sanctuary, preventing my hand from striking down one who once might have been considered a foe.~
@12199 = ~You have rendered a service of inestimable value, <CHARNAME>. The significance of this moment is not lost on me, and I assure you, your efforts will be rewarded most generously.~
@12200 = ~However, our path does not end here. There is intricate work ahead. I must study the arcane intricacies necessary for the fusion process of the Kerykeion.~
@12201 = ~Such rituals are delicate and require meticulous preparation, steeped in ancient magic and precise incantations.~
@12202 = ~In the meantime, ensure that all is in order within the guild. Complete your outstanding missions, maintain the equilibrium we've established.~
@12203 = ~But stay vigilant and within reach. Once the preparations are complete, we will need every able hand, every sharp mind for the trials that lie ahead.~
@12204 = ~The convergence of the Kerykeion's shards is not just an event, it is a cataclysmic shift waiting to unfold.~
@12205 = ~Our actions in the coming trials will not only reshape our fate but will also redefine the very essence of power and influence in this realm.~
@12206 = ~Prepare yourself, <CHARNAME>, for we stand on the threshold of a new era defined by our will.~
