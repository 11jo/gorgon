@8000 = ~I haven't the time nor desire to speak with you at present.~
@8001 = ~<CHARNAME>, the newest shadow amidst our ranks. Your performance has been the subject of much discussion, and in your shadow, there lies potential.~
@8002 = ~As a Hidden One within the Church of Mask, I observe and guide where darkness falls, and it seems you have garnered attention beyond the immediate confines of this guild.~
@8003 = ~Danika, a Demarchess under my tutelage, stands at a crucial juncture in her path of service to Mask.~
@8004 = ~Her training, rich in the lore and practice of our faith, must now be supplemented with practical experience.~
@8005 = ~I have spoken with her about the prospect of joining you on your missions, to not only broaden her horizons but also to lend her unique skills and insights to your endeavors.~
@8006 = ~This proposed alliance is more than a mere addition to your team; it represents a fusion of our sacred arts, enhancing your strategies with the subtlety and cunning our faith embodies.~
@8007 = ~If you find value in this, I encourage you to discuss it further with her. She is well-prepared and awaits your decision.~
@8008 = ~Together, your combined strengths could greatly benefit the objectives at hand and further the agenda of our Lord of Shadows.~
@8009 = ~Now, what is it that you seek? How may I assist you in the paths you tread within our enigmatic fold?~
@8010 = ~I'm interested in learning about the Kerykeion, can you tell me anything about it?~
@8011 = ~How did Baldwin become known as "The Butcher"?~
@8012 = ~What is your role here in the guild?~
@8013 = ~Nothing at the moment.~
@8014 = ~What do you seek on this path? How can I guide you further in our shared pursuit under the cloak of Mask?~
@8015 = ~Master Saradin, I have studied the tenets of our faith diligently and am prepared to recite the sacred dogma of Mask.~
@8016 = ~I can tell you many things. What is it that you wish to know?~
@8017 = ~Why is Baldwin so interested in the Kerykeion?~
@8018 = ~Can you tell me more about the Kerykeion's history?~
@8019 = ~What kind of power does the Kerykeion hold?~
@8020 = ~Who exactly were the Gorgon Sisters?~
@8021 = ~I'd like to ask you about something else.~
@8022 = ~It goes back to Baldwin's youth, steeped in the dreams and aspirations exchanged with his elder brother, Richard.~
@8023 = ~In the early days of their aspiring rogue-hood, Richard stumbled upon a mysterious manuscript in the depths of an ancient library.~
@8024 = ~The tome bore cryptic symbols and a veiled reference to the legendary staff, known then as the Caduceus.~
@8025 = ~With each passing day, Richard would regale Baldwin with tales of the staff's illustrious history, weaving a tapestry of ancient civilizations, forgotten realms, and the enigmatic figures who wielded its power.~
@8026 = ~Baldwin, at a young and impressionable age, found himself ensnared in the allure of the Kerykeion.~
@8027 = ~The staff's legend gripped his imagination, stoking the flames of his ambition. He yearned to wield its power and rewrite the course of history itself.~
@8028 = ~With unrefined skills and scarce resources at their disposal, they opted to align themselves with the Shadow Thieves, envisioning a path that would steer them towards the coveted acquisition of the staff.~
@8029 = ~As the years wore on, Baldwin's obsession with the staff deepened. His every waking moment was consumed by the singular purpose of attaining this artifact of unparalleled might.~
@8030 = ~He poured over dusty tomes, sought out long-forgotten sages, and ventured into treacherous realms in pursuit of any scrap of knowledge related to the staff.~
@8031 = ~It was this perilous imbalance that ultimately led to Baldwin's downfall within the ranks of the Shadow Thieves.~
@8032 = ~How did Baldwin lose the trust of the Shadow Thieves?~
@8033 = ~Baldwin's growing detachment from the affairs of the Shadow Thieves did not go unnoticed. His duties to the guild became secondary, his allegiance wavering.~
@8034 = ~The once loyal operative now walked a precarious line between the shadows and the seductive allure of the Kerykeion.~
@8035 = ~His disregard for the guild's directives, his flagrant pursuit of the staff, and his willingness to trespass into forbidden territories strained the fragile bonds of trust that held the guild together.~
@8036 = ~The fateful day arrived when Baldwin's insubordination could no longer be ignored. His own brother, Richard, faced an agonizing decision.~
@8037 = ~Fearing the catastrophic consequences of Baldwin's unchecked obsession, he made the painful choice to expose him to the Shadow Thieves' leadership.~
@8038 = ~The revelation of Baldwin's transgressions shattered the guild's confidence in him.~
@8039 = ~The council, faced with no alternative, decreed his banishment, a sentence that cast him into the unforgiving realm beyond the guild's sanctuary.~
@8040 = ~What happened after his banishment?~
@8041 = ~After the decree of banishment severed Baldwin's ties with the Shadow Thieves, a bitter fire smoldered within him. He sought revenge on the Shadow Thieves, his heart hardened by the sting of betrayal.~
@8042 = ~Fuelled by a vengeful resolve, he struck back, exacting retribution with calculated precision. In shadows deep, he silenced those who had betrayed him, sparing only his brother, Richard.~
@8043 = ~Baldwin, now a pariah, set forth on a solitary journey, fueled by a singular purpose, to seize the Kerykeion and claim the power that had consumed his every waking thought.~
@8044 = ~With stolen documents clutched in his hand, Baldwin fled north to Beregost, a town cloaked in wilderness and intrigue.~
@8045 = ~Here, he forged the Gorgon's Eye, a sanctuary for outcasts, a refuge for those drawn to the allure of forbidden power.~
@8046 = ~Its name echoes the ancient staff's legend, a constant reminder of his unyielding pursuit.~
@8047 = ~Baldwin's purpose was clear. Relentlessly track the path to the Kerykeion, with the shadows of Beregost concealing his unwavering resolve.~
@8048 = ~What can you tell me about Baldwin's time in the Shadow Thieves?~
@8049 = ~During the intervening years between Baldwin's induction into the Shadow Thieves and his eventual banishment, he ascended through the ranks with calculated finesse.~
@8050 = ~His reputation as a skilled rogue with a penchant for command solidified, particularly within the Athkatla branch in Amn.~
@8051 = ~There, he operated directly under the formidable Renal Bloodscalp, a name synonymous with notoriety and power.~
@8052 = ~Baldwin's tenure was marked by a duality of loyalty to the guild and an insatiable hunger for arcane knowledge, both fueled by his ambitions.~
@8053 = ~He executed missions with surgical precision, earning respect and trust among his peers.~
@8054 = ~Yet, in the shadows, he was consumed by his relentless quest for the Kerykeion, his obsession a carefully guarded secret.~
@8055 = ~It was this very duality that would eventually fracture his allegiance, culminating in a fateful clash of loyalties that led to his expulsion from the guild he once called home.~
@8056 = ~Can you tell me anything more about his brother, Richard?~
@8057 = ~Richard was a figure of exceptional acumen and finesse within the realm of rogues. His intellect was formidable, matched only by his precise execution of covert operations.~
@8058 = ~Richard's approach was marked by a directness that brooked no deviation, and an unyielding resolve that garnered him respect.~
@8059 = ~However, in the shadow of his younger sibling, Richard's aspirations paled in comparison.~
@8060 = ~While he excelled in the craft of thievery and subterfuge, he lacked the same fervent ambition and relentless drive that defined Baldwin's pursuit of power and knowledge.~
@8061 = ~This divergence in their pursuits, while it set them on separate paths, also served to underline the unique strengths and weaknesses that each brought to their chosen trades.~
@8062 = ~The Kerykeion's history is a web of contradictions and shadowed truths, where certainty is elusive.~
@8063 = ~Once bearing the name Caduceus, it was wrought by a demon in the depths of the Underworld.~
@8064 = ~A being who would soon become ensnared by the voracious Gorgon sisters, their insatiable hunger for power sealing its fate.~
@8065 = ~Yet, the tale takes a darker turn with their mortal half-sister, Medusa, consumed by envy at their immortality and eternal prowess.~
@8066 = ~With a malevolent twist of fate, she wove the staff into her dark arts, imprisoning the essence of her immortal kin within, birthing the Kerykeion and forever cursing their existence.~
@8067 = ~Their petrified forms coiled endlessly around its length, a grim testament to their eternal entrapment.~
@8068 = ~Through epochs and realms, the Kerykeion passed hands, from god to god, demon to demon, until it eventually found its way to the realms of Faerun, emerging in the wake of the Time of Troubles.~
@8069 = ~Accounts diverge on its exploits and fate, but all culminate in the same somber conclusion.~
@8070 = ~The staff met its end, shattering into fragments that now lie strewn across the disparate reaches of the Sword Coast, awaiting a soul bold enough to seek its dark embrace.~
@8071 = ~What kind of power does the Kerykeoin hold?~
@8072 = ~In the annals of arcane artifacts, the Kerykeion stands as a testament to power, shrouded in a malevolence that chills the very soul.~
@8073 = ~Known foremost for its dread ability to petrify any who dare meet its gaze, this fell staff harbors an even darker secret.~
@8074 = ~It is said that with a whispered incantation, it can summon forth an unending swarm of serpents, a nightmarish tide that answers only to its master's call.~
@8075 = ~Yet, amidst these harrowing abilities, a scroll bears witness to an even more sinister power, the unlocking of a mage's constraints on spellcasting, rendering arcane incantations a seamless extension of one's aura.~
@8076 = ~In the shadowed depths of the Underworld, the Gorgon Sisters, Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa, were serpent-like beings with an insatiable hunger.~
@8077 = ~Their sustenance extended beyond mortal prey, to a ravenous quest for power itself. Amidst the Underworld's labyrinthine expanse, they sought out dark creatures and formidable foes.~
@8078 = ~With serpentine precision, they would strike, their venomous fangs injecting a potent elixir that drained their victims of vitality.~
@8079 = ~The sisters reveled in the rush of power that surged through their veins with each conquest, their voracity growing with every fallen adversary.~
@8080 = ~In the heart of the Underworld, they were both predators and rulers, their dominion unchallenged, their hunger never sated.~
@8081 = ~Medusa, the lone mortal among them, harbored a bitter jealousy born from her mortality. This resentment festered, intensifying her desire for power and propelling her down a treacherous path.~
@8082 = ~It was amidst this insatiable pursuit that the dark tale of the Kerykeion unfurled.~
@8083 = ~For the Gorgon Sisters' voracity played a pivotal role in the staff's creation and the subsequent entrapment of their essence.~
@8084 = ~Forever bound to its malevolent influence, their tragic legacy became inseparable from the ominous aura of the Kerykeion. ~
@8085 = ~In the realms of the Underworld, their name would echo through the ages as a testament to the perilous hunger for both prey and power.~
@8086 = ~"The Butcher" moniker bestowed upon Baldwin is a testament to the ruthless efficiency with which he operated within the infamous ranks of the Shadow Thieves.~
@8087 = ~Even beyond the guild's darkened halls, Baldwin's reputation echoed through the streets.~
@8088 = ~It was a name whispered with a mix of awe and trepidation, for those outside the guild had borne witness to the aftermath of his operations.~
@8089 = ~Baldwin's methods were uncompromising, leaving a trail of blood and calculated chaos in his wake.~
@8090 = ~To those who glimpsed the aftermath, he was, "The Butcher", a title born of equal parts respect for his formidable skill and a stark acknowledgment of the unforgiving nature of his work in the field.~
@8091 = ~I'd like to ask you something else.~
@8092 = ~Ah, I am but a humble follower of Mask, known as a Hidden One within the revered ranks of the church.~
@8093 = ~My purpose lies in offering measured guidance and insights, ever mindful of the shadowed path we tread.~
@8094 = ~As a high-ranking member, my duty is to serve the greater cause, to further Mask's enigmatic agenda, focused on the art of thievery and the elusive dance of shadows.~
@8095 = ~It is in this capacity that I find myself aligned with the Gorgon's Eye and its astute leader, Baldwin.~
@8096 = ~Together, we navigate the delicate tapestry of intrigue, ensuring that our pursuits align seamlessly with the clandestine designs of our patron deity.~
@8097 = ~Your role and wisdom intrigue me. Could you share some of your history?~
@8098 = ~Can you tell me more about Danika? How does she fit into the workings of the guild and the church?~
@8099 = ~I'm curious about Mask. What can you tell me about this deity, and what does worshiping Mask entail for its followers?~
@8100 = ~I'm interested in the ways of Mask and your church. What steps must one take to become a member?~
@8101 = ~My past, much like the shadows we revere, is layered and complex. Hailing from the enigmatic land of Thay, my life has been a testament to the intricate teachings of Mask.~
@8102 = ~I served at a grand temple in Bezantur, a city as steeped in secrecy as the deity we worship. It was there, amidst the veiled schemes and hidden knowledge, that I found my calling.~
@8103 = ~During the tumultuous times of the Salamander War, my role transcended the confines of the temple. I found myself offering counsel to Aznar Thrul, an esteemed Red Wizard and one of the leaders of Thay.~
@8104 = ~My insights, drawn from the depths of shadowy wisdom, proved invaluable in navigating the intricate web of politics and power that defined that era.~
@8105 = ~My expertise, however, extends beyond mere counsel. As a master chronicler, my life has been dedicated to the pursuit and understanding of ancient artifacts and hidden powers.~
@8106 = ~It is this very pursuit that brought me to the Gorgon's Eye and into an alliance with Baldwin and the Gorgon's Eye.~
@8107 = ~Our goal is singular yet profound: to locate and restore the Kerykeion, a relic of immense power and mystery.~
@8108 = ~Its fractured pieces, scattered across the Sword Coast, hold secrets that resonate deeply with the teachings of our Lord of Shadows.~
@8109 = ~This quest is not merely an academic endeavor. It is a journey that aligns with the divine will of Mask, a pursuit that embodies the very essence of our faith.~
@8110 = ~As we seek to piece together the Kerykeion, we tread a path laden with intrigue and hidden knowledge, a path that I have walked my entire life.~
@8111 = ~In this, Baldwin and I are united, our goals intertwined with the shadowy tapestry of fate itself.~
@8112 = ~Ah, Danika. She is indeed a remarkable soul, one whose life threads have been intricately woven by the very shadows we worship.~
@8113 = ~I took her into the Church of Mask at a very tender age, a child found amidst turmoil and strife.~
@8114 = ~It was evident, even then, that she was touched by a rare and potent force, a latent power that resonated deeply with the enigmatic ethos of our Lord of Shadows.~
@8115 = ~Her journey from those early days to her current standing as a Demarchess has been nothing short of extraordinary.~
@8116 = ~Danika's unwavering devotion, her keen understanding of strategy and stealth, are a testament to the teachings of Mask.~
@8117 = ~She embodies the very principles we uphold: subtlety, cunning, and the relentless pursuit of our hidden agendas.~
@8118 = ~Within the Gorgon's Eye, Danika serves a pivotal role. She is not just a representative of our Church but a critical asset in aligning our covert operations with the divine will of Mask.~
@8119 = ~Her insights and strategies have proven invaluable, seamlessly intertwining our sacred mission with the guild's endeavors.~
@8120 = ~As her mentor and guide, I have watched her grow and hone her skills. She is my protege, and our journey from Thay to Beregost has been one of continuous learning and adaptation.~
@8121 = ~Together, we strive to further the enigmatic agenda of our deity, ensuring that every step we take is shrouded in the wisdom of shadows.~
@8122 = ~Danika, with her unique talents and unwavering faith, is an integral part of our intricate dance within the world of shadows.~
@8123 = ~Her path, like ours, is one that weaves through darkness and secrecy, always in service to the greater cause of the Church of Mask.~
@8124 = ~Mask, the Lord of Shadows, is a deity shrouded in enigma, revered by those who cherish the arts of stealth and thievery.~
@8125 = ~Worshipping Mask involves embracing the shadows, mastering the art of subtlety, and understanding the deeper truths that lie beneath surface appearances.~
@8126 = ~Followers believe in the fluidity of ownership and see deception as a valuable tool.~
@8127 = ~The church's teachings emphasize cunning and adaptability, encouraging the faithful to maneuver through life's complexities as adeptly as a shadow moves through light.~
@8128 = ~Our rituals and practices are often hidden, mirroring the elusive nature of our deity.~
@8129 = ~As a devoted follower of Mask, one gains not just spiritual fulfillment but also tangible benefits that align with our deity's domain.~
@8130 = ~Devotees are often blessed with enhanced skills in stealth and deception, aiding them in both mundane and divine pursuits.~
@8131 = ~The church provides a network of like-minded individuals, offering support and shared knowledge in our clandestine endeavors.~
@8132 = ~Most importantly, true followers are sometimes granted divine insights and revelations, enabling them to perceive and manipulate the world in ways others cannot.~
@8133 = ~The purpose of joining is to become part of a greater, shadowy whole, moving unseen and influencing events from the darkness.~
@8134 = ~This path is not for the faint of heart, but for those who seek power and understanding beyond the ordinary, it offers rewards unparalleled.~
@8135 = ~To join the ranks of Mask's faithful, one must demonstrate a keen understanding of subtlety and secrecy.~
@8136 = ~Prospective members undergo a rigorous process where their skills in stealth, manipulation, and discretion are tested. Loyalty to Mask's tenets is paramount.~
@8137 = ~Aspirants are often required to complete tasks that reflect the deity's ethos, proving their worthiness to embrace the shadowed path.~
@8138 = ~The journey to becoming a full-fledged member is as much about inner transformation as it is about external proficiency.~
@8139 = ~One must embody the very essence of shadows, becoming an unseen force that influences the world from behind a veil of mystery.~
@8140 = ~I'm interested in joining the ranks of the Church and devoting myself to Mask.~
@8141 = ~Your interest in the Church of Mask and in walking the path of shadows is commendable.~
@8142 = ~However, the church is selective in its acceptance of devotees, particularly favoring those with an innate affinity for the thieving arts.~
@8143 = ~It is these skills that resonate most deeply with the teachings and essence of Mask.~
@8144 = ~While I note your eagerness, without this intrinsic connection to the arts of stealth and subterfuge, it is challenging to fully embrace the path we tread.~
@8145 = ~Continue to hone your skills and understanding of our ways. Perhaps in time, your path may align more closely with the shadowed journey of Mask.~
@8146 = ~Ah, a seeker of the shadows in our midst. Your path as a thief aligns well with the teachings of Mask.~
@8147 = ~To begin your journey into the Church of Mask, you must first embrace the role of the 'Unproved.'~
@8148 = ~This is a novice position, a starting point on your path to understanding the deeper truths of our Lord of Shadows.~
@8149 = ~Your first task is to internalize the core dogma of Mask: a creed that emphasizes subtlety, deception, and the acquisition of wealth through cunning means.~
@8150 = ~Study these teachings, for they are the foundation upon which your journey will be built. When you have fully grasped the essence of this dogma, return to me and recite it in full.~
@8151 = ~Only then can you proceed to the next trial, proving your worthiness to walk further down this shadowed path.~
@8152 = ~Remember, the way of Mask is not merely about thievery, but the art of manipulation, the crafting of plausible untruths, and the mastery of subtlety.~
@8153 = ~It is a path that requires finesse and a keen understanding of the nuances of deceit and shadow. Prove yourself adept in these arts, and you shall find your place within our ranks.~
@8154 = ~Very well. Step forward into the shadow's embrace and recite the dogma. Let each word reflect your understanding and commitment to the path of Mask.~
@8155 = ~This is more than mere memorization; it is a demonstration of your alignment with the principles that guide our order. Speak now, and let the shadows bear witness to your devotion.~
@8156 = ~Foolish are those who value honesty, but a semblance of truth holds great worth.~
@8157 = ~Honesty is the refuge of the simple-minded, but the appearance of honesty is a valuable tool.~
@8158 = ~Only the naive prize honesty, while the illusion of truthfulness is precious.~
@8159 = ~True honesty is for the unwise, but the art of seeming honest is invaluable.~
@8160 = ~Honesty is for fools, but apparent honesty is a very valuable thing.~
@8161 = ~Honesty belongs to the foolish, yet the art of feigned honesty is priceless.~
@8162 = ~That is incorrect. The path of Mask demands precision and an unerring grasp of its tenets. What you have recited deviates from the core teachings.~
@8163 = ~Reflect upon our dogma once more, absorb its essence, and when you are ready, return to me.~
@8164 = ~Make every untruth seem plausible, and never lie when you can cleave to the truth but leave a mistaken impression; a bridge burned means much rebuilding if you need to cross over there again.~
@8165 = ~In all things, subtlety reigns supreme.~
@8166 = ~Subtlety is everything.~
@8167 = ~The essence of all is found in subtlety.~
@8168 = ~Above all, cherish the art of subtlety.~
@8169 = ~Subtlety holds the key to all endeavors.~
@8170 = ~At the heart of matters, subtlety prevails.~
@8171 = ~A bribe is the least subtle of the tools Mask gives to us. Never force someone to do something when you can manipulate them into doing it and thinking the decision and the deed are entirely their own freewilled work.~
@8172 = ~Avoid the expected, unless it masks another, more hidden act.~
@8173 = ~Eschew the apparent, only employing it to veil further schemes.~
@8174 = ~Shun the straightforward path, unless it serves to obscure deeper plans.~
@8175 = ~Refrain from the evident, unless it's a cover for other, covert operations.~
@8176 = ~Steer clear of the clear-cut, except when it shadows other, underlying intents.~
@8177 = ~Never do the obvious, except to conceal a secondary or tertiary deed or arrangement.~
@8178 = ~Spin secrets atop secrets, but do so unconcernedly, not with the sly excitement of untutored youth.~
@8179 = ~Place faith in the darkness, as light often leads to vulnerability.~
@8180 = ~Rely on the obscurity of shadows, for paths well-lit invite danger.~
@8181 = ~In shadows, trust; for in brightness, one becomes an effortless mark.~
@8182 = ~Trust in the shadows, for the bright way makes for easy targets.~
@8183 = ~Seek solace in the shadows, for the illuminated way is a path to peril.~
@8184 = ~Embrace the concealment of shadows, as clarity often renders one exposed.~
@8185 = ~Well done. Your grasp of the Tenets of the Unseen shows promising depth. In the Church of Mask, such understanding is the first step to truly walk in the Lord of Shadows favor.~
@8186 = ~Remember, these tenets are not just words but guiding principles for your actions and decisions. As you embody these teachings, you will find your place among us.~
@8187 = ~When you feel ready to delve deeper into the shadows and face the challenges that lie ahead, return here. Your next trial awaits, and with it, a further step into our fold.~
@8188 = ~It appears Baldwin was ill-equipped, both in mind and body, to wield the Kerykeion.~
@8189 = ~The essence of the Gorgon Sisters shattered through his faculties, twisting his form into that grotesque abomination. Unfortunate, but undeniably fascinating.~
@8190 = ~A pity about the staff, It saddens me to know that we will never witness its reunification. However, the piece you now possess does seem to bear the genuine mark.~
@8191 = ~Take it back to the guild, to Rhade. He possesses the acumen to harness its potential, perhaps in ways Baldwin could not.~
@8192 = ~With Baldwin's absence, the mantle of guildmaster lies vacant. He saw in you the potential for leadership, a sentiment I concur with.~
@8193 = ~There's an aura about you, a quality that sets you apart. I believe it's in the best interest of the guild to place you at its helm.~
@8194 = ~The position is yours, if you're willing. What say you?~
@8195 = ~I accept your offer and shall assume control of the Gorgon's Eye as its guildmaster.~
@8196 = ~I accept your offer, but my path forward is uncertain, and I am unsure of how active a leader I can be.~
@8197 = ~I have no wish to lead the Gorgon's Eye at this time, so I must decline your offer.~
@8198 = ~Speak with me upon your return and I will discuss our operations at length.~
@8199 = ~Rest assured, the guild is adept at self-sustainability. When you return, we shall delve into our operations in detail.~
@8200 = ~It is regrettable, yet I sense the pull of a potent destiny guiding you towards a significant journey. I bid you farewell, and remember that the guild's facilities shall remain at your disposal.~
@8201 = ~Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. If you have a moment, I'd like to discuss your new responsibilities as guildmaster.~
@8202 = ~Yes, I am prepared to take charge of our guild's operations.~
@8203 = ~I have a few other matters to attend to first.~
@8204 = ~I will review each of your officers individually, and you can inform me of any adjustments you wish to make regarding their activities.~
@8205 = ~Rigaldo oversees all our general thieving activities, including pickpocketing, mugging, extortion, blackmail, break-ins, and safe-cracking.~
@8206 = ~Would you prefer his thieves to target upper-class marks, where both the risk and reward are higher, or should they focus on the general public for safety?~
@8207 = ~Go for the upper-class targets. Their possessions will outweigh the risk.~
@8208 = ~Stick with the general public. More marks, less chance of getting caught.~
@8209 = ~Should they aggressively mug as many targets as possible, or spend more time in stealth, waiting for the right moment to strike?~
@8210 = ~Have them hit as many targets as possible, even if it means using force.~
@8211 = ~Better to have them stick to the shadows, waiting for safer opportunities.~
@8212 = ~Regarding our protection racket, should we stick to the usual threats and blackmail, or use more physical violence if they are unwilling to cooperate?~
@8213 = ~Use violence if necessary. Fear will keep everyone in line.~
@8214 = ~I don't want people getting seriously hurt. Stick to using blackmail.~
@8215 = ~Very well, that covers Rigaldo. These instructions align with his thieves' abilities, and I foresee everything proceeding smoothly.~
@8216 = ~Next up is Zeda, our resident smuggler.~
@8217 = ~She primarily operates between Amn and Baldur's Gate to avoid conflict with other guilds. However, she could further expand her activities.~
@8218 = ~Keep her operating where she is. We don't want to instigate further trouble with the other guilds~
@8219 = ~Have her expand her operations further out. The risk is worth the opportunity.~
@8220 = ~Black lotus has been her most profitable venture since obtaining our new supplier. However, it is much riskier to transport and carries higher penalties than her usual goods do.~
@8221 = ~Do you want her to continue increasing her stock in lotus, or begin to temper her dealings with safer, less valuable items?~
@8222 = ~Have her continue focusing on the black lotus. Its higher profits should compensate for any bribes or bail we might have to pay.~
@8223 = ~Have her shift back more to her usual goods. I don't want her taking any unnecessary risks.~
@8224 = ~Alright, I believe she will be content with this set of instructions.~
@8225 = ~Your next officer is Liedel. She oversees all the bounty hunting and assassination contracts that we receive.~
@8226 = ~There isn't much to direct here, as she is fairly self-sufficient. You could have her cease assassination work altogether and focus only on live bounties, but doing so would create a noticeable decrease in our profits.~
@8227 = ~Have her continue the way she is then. She seems to have things under control.~
@8228 = ~I don't want innocent people being killed. Have her stick to the live bounties from now on.~
@8229 = ~I will inform her of your decision.~
@8230 = ~Next up is Gilbald and his gamesmen.~
@8231 = ~They currently have their games rigged to pay out 20% of their profits. If you increase the payout, more players will likely come to gamble, but less coin will be gained from each.~
@8232 = ~If you decrease the payout, fewer players will come to gamble, but the ones who do will end up losing more. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between the two.~
@8233 = ~Keep the payout at 20%. It seems to be working fine as is.~
@8234 = ~Increase the payout to 30%. Having more players coming in should be more profitable in the long run.~
@8235 = ~Decrease the payout to 10%. I want to extract as much money from the players as I can.~
@8236 = ~Alright, I will relay your decision to Gilbald.~
@8237 = ~Your next officer that needs direction is Madam Meredia, who is in charge of our courtesan wing.~
@8238 = ~If we increase her rates, it will attract fewer patrons overall, but the ones that do come would be wealthier and cleaner.~
@8239 = ~If we decrease her rates, more clients will come, but they will bring a higher risk of violence and disease. This could cause her staff to be unable to work for longer periods of time.~
@8240 = ~No need to change their rates then. Keep them as they are now.~
@8241 = ~Increase her rates. I wish them to have better quality clients who pose less risk.~
@8242 = ~I want to decrease her rates so we'll have more paying clients coming in.~
@8243 = ~I'll inform Meredia of your decision.~
@8244 = ~Your last venture to oversee, is Diomedes and his fighting pits.~
@8245 = ~Do you prefer an emphasis on honing our guilds combat skills through training, or do you lean more towards maximizing revenue from spectators?~
@8246 = ~Let's invest more time and resources into training programs, ensuring that each member reaches their full potential.~
@8247 = ~I want to focus on maximising revenue from the matches, which we can use to fund better equipment and facilities.~
@8248 = ~Diomedes has stated his opposition towards allowing deathmatches, however, if you wish to reimplement them, the final decision is yours, of course.~
@8249 = ~Allowing deathmatches raises the significant risk of losing valuable fighters whose expertise and experience could have been harnessed for the betterment of the guild.~
@8250 = ~However, they have the potential to spread intrigue and draw significantly larger crowds, thus creating higher-stakes and an increased revenue stream.~
@8251 = ~The potential benefits of introducing deathmatches are too substantial to ignore. Inform Diomedes I want them reopened.~
@8252 = ~Diomedes reservations about deathmatches are valid. We have thrived without them for a significant period and that is how we shall continue.~
@8253 = ~Alright, that is all I have for you at this time. I will make the rounds every seven days to collect our profits. Come see me then, and I will let you know how things have fared.~
@8254 = ~Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. I've just finished making the rounds, and all of your officers' reports are in.~

@8256 = ~How much will I be receiving?~
@8257 = ~The guild is operating at a low level of risk and has managed to bring in a total of 1000 gold coins. Would you like to make any changes to our activites?~
@8258 = ~I will keep them as they are for now.~
@8259 = ~I'd like to change their set of instructions.~
@8260 = ~The guild is operating at a moderate level of risk and has managed to bring in a total of 2000 gold coins. Would you like to make any changes to our activites?~
@8261 = ~The guild is operating at a high level of risk and has managed to bring in a total of 3000 gold coins. Would you like to make any changes to our activites?~
@8262 = ~Very good. Report back to me in one week's time.~
@8263 = ~There is still some time left before our reports are in. I will keep you updated if anything else requires your attention in the meantime.~
