@19000 = ~I've already made it clear, you've had enough for the night. You've certainly put a damper on your own evening. It's in your best interest to leave now.~
@19001 = ~There's a bloke here, bit of a hot-head. Best keep your distance, and steer clear of trouble.~
@19002 = ~Evenin', friend! What can I get ya?~
@19003 = ~I'm told you're only serving beer. Any reason for that?~
@19004 = ~Tell me about the crowd tonight. Anything interesting happening?~
@19005 = ~I'm here to keep an eye on things. Any troublemakers causing a ruckus?~
@19006 = ~I couldn't help but notice the courtesans mingling with the guests. Are they part of the entertainment for the evening?~
@19007 = ~I'll be going now.~
@19008 = ~Yes indeed, there's a grand party happenin' here, courtesy of some Waterdhavian bigwigs. They're makin' their way down to the Nashkel Carnival, and they've spared no expense!~
@19009 = ~Can you tell me anything about them?~
@19010 = ~Well, I'll tell ya, the lord's a jolly sort, enjoys his fun, he does. The lady, bless her heart, tends to be a bit... uh, light-headed, if you catch my drift.~
@19011 = ~She's always bumping into folks, and losing who knows what. But the people seem to adore her, so we let her be.~
@19012 = ~Well, you'll be pleased to know that the bouncer over there is keeping things under tight watch. Security's a top priority, so you can relax and enjoy the festivities.~
@19013 = ~Aye, they are indeed, adding a touch of elegance to the affair. They're skilled in the art of conversation and company, ensuring the guests have a memorable evening.~
@19014 = ~Aye, it's the guard's request. He wants to keep things from gettin' too rowdy. We wouldn't want no trouble during this fine affair, now would we?~
@19015 = ~Is there a way we could work around this restriction? Some guests have a taste for the stronger stuff, and they might appreciate the option.~
@19016 = ~Sometimes rules can be... adjusted for the right compensation. Coin? Companionship? Would that be the case here?~
@19017 = ~I've heard serious accidents can be pretty common in this line of work. Let's just say it would be in your best interest to find a way to serve the stronger stuff.~
@19018 = ~I understand your concern, I do. But I'm afraid I can't risk it. The guards are being quite vigilant, and I've got to think of the safety of everyone here. I hope you understand.~
@19019 = ~Well, now, I never! I run an honest establishment here, I do. The guards have been quite clear, and I won't be jeopardizing my business or anyone's safety for a bit of extra coin.~
@19020 = ~What if I set you up with one of the lovely courtesans? My treat.~
@19021 = ~Listen, I can handle myself just fine, thank you very much. But don't think for a moment I won't call the guard over if you force my hand, understood?~
@19022 = ~Understand this, barkeep. Start dishin' out the hard stuff or you'll be havin' a private chat with my blade.~
@19023 = ~I'm cuttin' you off for now, mate. I've got enough on my plate without your trouble.~
@19024 = ~Oh... ahem. It's a deal. I'll see to it that the stronger spirits find their way, discreetly, of course. And you, my friend, be sure to speak highly of me to the lovely ladies.~
@19025 = ~Just try to keep any trouble to a minimum, alright? We've got some guests in the crowd who are a bit like tinder to a flame. Quick to anger and easily agitated.~
@19026 = ~Best to steer clear of anything that might ruffle their feathers.~
@19027 = ~Alright, I get it, no need to keep at it. I'll see to it that the stronger stuff finds its way into the hands of those who can handle it.~
@19028 = ~Enjoy the party. If you need your mug filled, you know where to find me.~
