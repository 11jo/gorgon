@11000 = ~If I don't rid myself of that cursed dryad soon, we might just have to abandon this place and head home. She raided our camp again last night, laying waste to half our supplies.~
@11001 = ~You wouldn't happen to be here on our behalf, would you? I've put a reward on the head of that witch, Katreda, but so far, no one has stepped up to the task.~
@11002 = ~I'm here to assist Katreda. Gather your men and depart. Seek another forest for your lodge.~
@11003 = ~Katreda has offered me a more substantial reward. You'll have to do better if you want my help.~
@11004 = ~Why on earth would you support that... malevolent creature?~
@11005 = ~Bah! You bounty hunter scum are all the same!~
@11006 = ~Normally I would despise killing anything without conducting a proper chase, alas, I tire of these games.~
@11007 = ~I'll deal with the dryad myself after I finish with you lot. You see, these weapons weren't just made for hunting boar!~
