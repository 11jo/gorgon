@66000 = ~Well now, looks like we've got a right curious visitor. What brings you to our little gathering?~
@66001 = ~Wait a moment, I know you! You're the one who lifted my gold over at the gambling tents!~
@66002 = ~Ah, so you're the mark I happened upon! Well, no harm done, I suppose. A mere hundred gold, a trifle in the grand scheme of things. It was all in good fun, I assure you.~
@66003 = ~Here, take it back. No sense in holdin' onto a pittance like that. Consider it an exchange of wits, friend.~
@66004 = ~Stealth and skill, that's the Vitiare way. Watch and learn, my friend.~
@66005 = ~Behold, the infamous Vitiare, master of shadows and procurer of wealth!~
@66006 = ~In the realm of thievery, none can rival Vitiare's finesse and cunning!~
@66007 = ~To some, it's stealing. To me, it's acquiring what's rightfully mine, by skill or by guile.~
