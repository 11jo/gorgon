@49500 = ~The winds of intrigue blow strong in these alleys. I'm Soren, and my ears catch whispers that many miss.~
@49501 = ~You have the look of someone seeking... information. Lucky for you, knowledge is my trade. For the right price, of course.~
@49502 = ~There was a shipment of tomes bound for Candlekeep that never made it to their destination. Know anything about it?~
@49503 = ~I need information on Isla Darkcloak. She's a fortress within these markets, untouchable. I need to know her usual routes, habits, weaknesses, anything that can be exploited.~
@49504 = ~I'm not interested.~
@49505 = ~Missing tomes, destined for the hallowed halls of Candlekeep? Dangerous business, that. I might have a tidbit or two for you, if you're willing.~
@49506 = ~How much will this information cost me?~
@49507 = ~Well, out with it. What do you know about the tomes?~
@49508 = ~Let's add a touch of intrigue, shall we? I suggest a fair exchange. A secret shared for a secret gathered.~
@49509 = ~A common method by which I conduct my affairs. It allows me to extend my reach across the realm, you see.~
@49510 = ~Provide me with information on a specific individual, and in turn, you shall receive the answers you seek.~
@49511 = ~Very well, I'm in. What specific information do you need, and who is this individual?~
@49512 = ~I can't have those tomes vanish into thin air. Tell me where they are, and I'll return the favor after they're recovered.~
@49513 = ~Is there no way to expedite this with a sum of gold? I really don't have time for this.~
@49514 = ~Sorry, friend. But that's not how this business works. Rest assured, the tomes you seek are safe, and won't be moving anytime soon.~
@49515 = ~The seller is a cautious one, and knows when to bide their time. They'll be waiting for the heat to dissipate from the heist before making their move.~
@49516 = ~Gold? A transaction so... pedestrian. While it may grease many a wheel, my friend, some matters require a touch more finesse.~
@49517 = ~However, considering your urgency, I shall accept your proposal. 2000 gold coins, and you shall have your answers. A fair exchange, considering the value of those tomes.~
@49518 = ~It's a deal. Now, tell me where I can find those books.~
@49519 = ~I'm not paying that much. What was the infomation you wanted me to uncover?~
@49520 = ~There's a meeting of some significance transpiring on the second floor of the Keexie Tavern. Captain Velendra of the Flaming Fist and some foreign merchants are convening.~
@49521 = ~Their discussions are veiled in secrecy, and I believe it pertains to a valuable shipment. You must be present, but concealed from their notice.~
@49522 = ~Captain Velendra's got a sharp eye. Should she sense an eavesdropper, she's liable to vanish without a trace.~
@49523 = ~Infiltrate the meeting, stick to the shadows, and gather the information. Once you've done so, I shall be here, ready to provide you with the location of those coveted tomes.~
@49524 = ~Keep in mind, this task will require the finesse of a true rogue. Avoid relying on potions and spells, they won't suffice, and the Captain will know.~
@49525 = ~Your success hinges on your own skills, your ability to blend into the shadows and move with silent grace. Trust in your instincts, and let your true rogue senses guide you.~
@49526 = ~Rely on your true rogue senses and skills to hide in the shadows. Once you've done so, I shall be here, ready to provide you with the location of those coveted tomes.~
@49527 = ~Understood. I'll stick to the shadows and get the job done.~
@49528 = ~Ah, you've returned. Have you uncovered the information we seek, or do you require more time?~
@49529 = ~They're meeting tomorrow at the northern gates to exchange a shipment of high-quality weaponry from Mirabar.~
@49530 = ~Captain Velendra caught wind of my presence and left before discussing anything of significance.~
@49531 = ~Excellent work, my stealthy friend. This information is of great value. With it, we hold leverage that could prove most beneficial. Now, for your reward.~
@49532 = ~The missing tomes, they are to be displayed tonight for the eyes of potential buyers. Their meeting spot will be at the docks quartered near the Temple of Umberlee.~
@49533 = ~A discrete gathering, no doubt. This intel is yours to exploit. Go, claim what is rightfully yours.~
@49534 = ~Disappointing, indeed. Can't afford missteps in this line of work, especially with matters as delicate as this.~
@49535 = ~If you're still intent on obtaining my information on the tomes, I'm afraid it will require compensation.~
@49536 = ~2000 gold coins, no less. It's a steep price, but consider it an investment in your future endeavors.~
@49537 = ~Very well, Soren. Here's the money. Tell me what I need to know.~
@49538 = ~I won't be swindled, Soren. Lower the price, or you'll get nothing from me.~
@49539 = ~I'm not ready to pay that much at the moment.~
@49540 = ~Unfortunate, but I understand. The offer stands, should you change your mind.~
@49541 = ~Return when you've gathered the necessary funds. The information will be waiting for you, provided you come prepared.~
@49542 = ~I trust you've come prepared with the necessary funds? Once I have them, I'll gladly share my information about the tomes.~
@49543 = ~Here are the 2000 gold coins. Now, tell me what I need to know.~
@49544 = ~I'm still working on it.~
@49545 = ~Ah, the art of information. It's a dance of whispers and shadows, my friend. A dance I've become rather adept at, if I do say so myself.~
@49546 = ~Your talents are noted, Soren. I'll reach out when your particular brand of expertise is required.~
@49547 = ~Keep you voice down, will you? She's got ears like a hawk and a temper to match, so keep this conversation discreet. This is a high-profile target you're sniffin' at.~
@49548 = ~Now, I do hold the keys to the secrets you seek, but such knowledge comes at a price... and not just in gold.~
@49549 = ~There's a lock in the Flaming Fist Headquarter's basement, hiding some valuable documents I've had my eye on for a while.~
@49550 = ~If you can sneak in, pick that lock, and bring those papers to me, then we'll talk about Isla Darkcloak. Consider it a fair trade... your skills for my information.~
@49551 = ~Consider those documents as good as yours.~
@49552 = ~I'm not sure breaking into the Flaming Fist Headquarters is a risk worth taking. There must be another way to get your information.~
@49553 = ~That's the deal on the table, friend. It's a risky venture, but that's the price for high-value information.~
@49554 = ~If you're not up for it, then you'll need to find your answers elsewhere. My terms are firm on this one.~
@49555 = ~Fine... I'll get you those documents. But this had better be worth it.~
@49556 = ~I'll pass. The risks outweigh the benefits here. I'll find another way to get what I need.~
@49557 = ~Suit yourself. Offer's off the table then. In the shadows of Baldur's Gate, information like this doesn't come easy. Good luck finding another way in, you're going to need it.~
@49558 = ~Excellent. Remember, discretion is key in this job. Get in, get the documents, and get out without a trace.~
@49559 = ~Once you've got them, bring them back to me, and then we'll talk. Good luck.~
@49560 = ~Ah, I see you've returned in one piece. I trust you were able to slip in undetected. Do you have the documents with you?~
@49561 = ~The documents are in my hands. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the deal.~
@49562 = ~Alright, here's what I've got on Isla. Most nights, she frequents a tavern located near the city's gates.~
@49563 = ~She prefers a spot close to the exit, a tactical choice, no doubt, for a quick getaway if needed. It's one of her rare predictable habits.~
@49564 = ~If you're planning to approach her, that's your best shot. But be warned, she's always on her guard, even when she's enjoying her drink.~
@49565 = ~Good luck with Isla, you're going to need it. Now, keep it moving. You've got what you need.~
