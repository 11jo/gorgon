@200=~The Beregost locals talk of a haunted tunnel behind Feldepost's Inn. It might be worth investigating to uncover the truth.~

@201=~A young lad informed me of some unsavory looking characters entering a tunnel behind Feldpost's Inn. Perhaps I should conduct a thorough investigation of the area.~

@202=~I've aligned myself with the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild in Beregost. In the days to come, uncertainty reigns, but for now, there's a promise of coin to be had. I should first seek Rigaldo, who will direct my tasks within the guild.~

@203=~I've encountered one of Baldwin's operatives fresh from a skirmish with the Shadow Thieves. He's secured vital documents regarding the guild's future. These must be promptly delivered to Baldwin for assessment.~

@204=~Ariosh made an intriguing proposition today, offering a chance to join his crew in their ventures of thievery on the streets of Beregost.The work is risky, no doubt, but it has a certain allure. For now, I've declined the offer. It doesn't quite align with my current pursuits. Still, I'll keep it in mind, jotting down the details. One never knows when a change of heart might come or when the thrill of such ventures may beckon me back into the shadows.~

@205=~The streets are eerily quiet these days, a lull in the usual hustle and bustle. Ariosh assures me that soon enough, the city will stir with fresh opportunities. Patience, it seems, is the sharpest blade in a rogue's arsenal. I'll bide my time and return when the moment is ripe for new mischief.~

@206=~Today I crossed paths with Naga, a Demarchess of Mask, who, with only a glance, discerned the rogue within me.  In exchange for a generous donation to the Church of Mask, she has offered 'The Thief's Compendium', a collection of texts steeped in the shadowy arts. The knowledge within promises to hone my skills in ways that could be invaluable. Yet, the cost is substantial, demanding nefarious means to secure the required gold. I must ponder this path with care, for it holds both promise and peril. The shadows beckon, but at what price?~

@210=~Mage in the Mountains

Atop the treacherous peaks of the Gibberling Mountains, a formidable mage guards a piece of the Kerykeion. Baldwin has entrusted me with the task of confronting her to secure this vital artifact. It's clear that this won't be a simple negotiation. I must steel myself for a battle of arcane might and wits.~

@211=~Mage in the Mountains

I vanquished the mage atop the Gibberling Mountains and successfully obtained the Kerykeion fragment. Curiously, she alluded to encounters with other assailants identifying themselves as thieves in recent times. This information may hold deeper implications. I should report this development back to Baldwin promptly.~

@212=~Mage in the Mountains

I delivered the Kerykeion fragment to Baldwin, who expressed satisfaction with my success. He harbors suspicions that the faction that targeted the mage could be keeping a watchful eye on our activities as well. This revelation warrants our vigilance.~

@213=~Bombs over Beregost

As darkness falls, the Gorgon's Eye finds itself besieged by the relentless Shadow Thieves. Baldwin, learning of the assault, entrusted me with the task of eliminating their operatives within the city. Meanwhile, he tirelessly fortifies our guild's defenses, knowing that the ultimate confrontation is imminent.~

@214=~Bombs over Beregost

The streets now run with the spilled blood of the fallen Shadow Thieves. Among their ranks, I discovered a coded document, its enigmatic contents bound for Baldwin's discerning eyes. This piece of intel could prove invaluable in our struggle.~

@215=~Race to the Finish

The path ahead leads north, into the foreboding embrace of the Wood of Sharp Teeth. There, a smuggler with a coveted piece of the Kerykeion is set to strike a dangerous bargain. Time is of the essence, for the Shadow Thieves' claws extend far and their reach is relentless. I must hasten to intercept the smuggler before they fall prey to those dark hands.~

@216=~Race to the Finish

In the hallowed halls of the elven ruins, a scene of dark betrayal played out before my eyes. Thamuz, driven by sinister purpose, struck down Nagate with ruthless efficiency. His ominous warning lingered in the air, painting a dire portrait of the consequences should Baldwin succeed in reassembling the Kerykeion. With resolve coursing through my veins, I silenced Thamuz and claimed the fragment, knowing that its power harbored both potential and peril.~

@217=~Race to the Finish

With the second piece of the Kerykeion in hand, I returned to Baldwin and shared Thamuz's ominous words. Baldwin, ever confident, assured me of the weapon's safety, though a seed of doubt lingered in my mind regarding his true intentions. He pledged to keep me informed of any developments pertaining to the Shadow Thieves or the enigmatic artifact. For now, all I could do was remain vigilant, treading the treacherous path that lay ahead.~

@218=~Gerard's Gambit

The note I delivered to Baldwin unveiled a disconcerting truth: Gerard Travenhurst and the inhabitants of Beregost have conspired with the Shadow Thieves, acting as spies and feeding them information about our guild. To seal this dark alliance, Gerard offered the Shadow Thieves the ultimate prize—the last shard of the Kerykeion. With this revelation, Baldwin has tasked me with rendezvousing at Gerard's manor, prepared to offer my support in case our meeting turns perilous. This treacherous turn of events only underscores the weight of our mission.~

@219=~Gerard's Gambit

A shocking turn of events unfolded as Baldwin successfully reassembled the Kerykeion. To my horror, he underwent a monstrous transformation, becoming a colossal serpent. It fell upon me, alongside the Shadow Thieves, to confront this newfound threat. With determination coursing through my veins, we fought valiantly, ultimately laying Baldwin to rest. This dark chapter, marked by sacrifice and betrayal, draws to a close, leaving behind a trail of questions and a lingering sense of uncertainty.~

@220=~Gerard's Gambit

Having assumed leadership of the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild, it falls upon me to set forth new directives for the members. Each must be assigned their roles with precision and purpose. Additionally, I must make haste in delivering the sole remaining fragment of the Kerykeion to Rhade. Perhaps he possesses the knowledge and skill to mend or enhance it in some manner. The weight of responsibility now rests heavily on my shoulders, and I must navigate this new chapter with shrewdness and resolve.~

@221=~Gerard's Gambit

The mantle of guildmaster for the Gorgon's Eye has been proffered to me, yet I find myself disinclined to accept. Time and inclination both elude me in this matter. Instead, I shall return to the guild and deliver the remaining Kerykeion piece to Rhade. Perhaps his expertise may yet mend or enhance it.~

@222=~No Honor Among Thieves

I've accepted Quass's offer to betray Baldwin and align with the Shadow Thieves. Their plan involves introducing a counterfeit Kerykeion piece, a deadly trap for Baldwin should he attempt its assembly. A covert operative within the Gorgon's Eye guild is set to make contact, using the phrase "The shortbow of the Shaar" to signal their presence. The wheels are in motion, and I must prepare for the pivotal role I'm to play..~

@223=~No Honor Among Thieves

I successfully handed over the fake Kerykeion piece to Baldwin without raising suspicion. Now, I must bide my time and await further instructions from the Shadow Thieves. Vigilance will be my closest ally in this delicate operation.~

@224=~No Honor Among Thieves

Rhade's true allegiance has been revealed. It's imperative that I meet with him immediately to discuss our next steps in this intricate dance of shadows.~

@225=~No Honor Among Thieves

Baldwin's life has been extinguished, and the Kerykeion lies shattered and beyond repair. The sole remaining fragment now rests in my possession, a token of appreciation from Richard for my invaluable assistance.~

          //////// Rigaldo's Quests /////////
          ///////////////////////////////////

          
@310=~Diamond in the Rough

My initial task from the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild involves purloining a diamond from Zieke, a fence residing at Feldepost's Inn. Caution is warranted, for his guards maintain a vigilant watch. I must employ stealth and precision, either slipping past them unnoticed or rendering them incapacitated to achieve my objective.~

@311=~Diamond in the Rough

With the diamond secured, I returned unscathed. Rigaldo rewarded me with a fine thieving ring, though it would have proven more useful prior to the mission.~

@312=~Mugging in the Manor

Rigaldo has tasked me with persuading Gerard Travenhurst to reinstate the protection payments and surrender his family pendant as collateral. I'll find him in the grand manor located in the northern part of Beregost.~

@313=~Mugging in the Manor

Gerard saw reason and agreed to my terms. I now possess his necklace and have his assurance of ongoing payments. It's time to return to Rigaldo at the Gorgon's Eye hideout and relay the news, although I suspect he might already be aware of the outcome.~

@314=~Mugging in the Manor

After my successful negotiation with Gerard Travenhurst, Rigaldo wasted no time in promoting me to an official member of the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild. It was a swift and unceremonious affair, marked by a nod of approval and a shared understanding of the trust bestowed upon me. This newfound status came with its own set of privileges and responsibilities, signaling a deeper involvement in the clandestine affairs of the guild.~

@315=~Buried Treasure

I set out to meet Karp, the fortunate farmer who seems to have stumbled upon a trove of hidden treasures on her farmland. The promise of not one, but two magical rings adds a certain allure to this task. Rigaldo's interest in acquiring them is understandable, given their potential value and utility. I must approach Karp with tact and convince her of the mutual benefit in parting with these newfound artifacts.~

@316=~Buried Treasure

With a persuasive touch, I managed to secure the rings from Karp. Her cooperation will undoubtedly be beneficial for both parties involved. Now, it's time to return to Rigaldo at the Gorgon's Eye hideout and claim the well-earned reward for my successful negotiation.~

@317=~Buried Treasure

Rigaldo's gratitude was palpable as I handed over the rings. He insisted that I keep one as a token of his appreciation for a job well done. It's a nice addition to my collection, and a reminder of the trust I've earned within the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild.~

@318=~A Fishy Request

Karp's plea for assistance weighs heavily on my mind. Smuggling two souls into the bustling city of Athkatla is no small feat, but I'm determined to find a way. I'll discreetly inquire within my network and seek out someone trustworthy who can aid Karp and her son in this perilous journey.~

@319=~A Fishy Request

Zeda's willingness to assist Karp is a glimmer of hope in this uncertain endeavor. I must now relay this crucial information to Karp, urging her to gather the necessary funds promptly. The meeting point in Beregost is set, and time is of the essence.~

@320=~A Fishy Request

Witnessing Karp's relief and determination to secure her son's safety is a testament to the impact we can have on others' lives. Her swift departure to Beregost, leaving behind a toxic past, is a courageous step towards a brighter future.~

@321=~It's All Fun and Games

Embarking on this task requires careful planning and swift execution. Infiltrating the Nashkel Carnival, I must navigate the bustling tents, ensuring I remain undetected as I abscond with the gamesmen's weapons. Once secured, meeting with Ariosh and his rogues behind the tents will be crucial. The distribution of these weapons will empower them to swiftly and efficiently carry out the operation, seizing the opportunity presented by the unguarded casinos. This venture promises both challenge and reward, and I must be prepared for any unforeseen obstacles that may arise.~

@322=~It's All Fun and Games

With the stun darts now in hand, I've successfully carried out the first phase of the plan. Distributing these potent weapons to Ariosh and his skilled comrades ensures they're well-prepared to raid the gambling tents at the Nashkel Carnival. As I make my way back to Beregost, I'm filled with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that this operation is now in motion. Upon my return, I must report the success of this pivotal step to Rigaldo, ensuring he's kept abreast of our progress.~

@323=~It's All Fun and Games

Rigaldo was more than pleased with the results of our operation at the Nashkel Carnival. He recognized my pivotal role and rewarded me generously with a substantial share of the winnings. This not only solidifies my standing within the Gorgon's Eye but also serves as a testament to my capabilities as a skilled operative. With this newfound wealth, I have both resources and influence at my disposal, setting the stage for even more daring ventures in the future.~

@324=~Borland's Spicy Secret

Borland's illicit dealings with black lotus in Beregost have not gone unnoticed by Rigaldo. It's now my task to approach him and ensure he starts sharing a portion of his profits with the Gorgon's Eye. If he proves resistant to this arrangement, I must be prepared to take more forceful measures, which could involve relieving him of his inventory of both spice and coin. This operation demands a delicate touch, but I am more than capable of handling it.~

@325=~Borland's Spicy Secret

Having paid a visit to Borland, I made my intentions clear. Now, it's time to report back to Rigaldo and update him on the outcome. It remains to be seen whether Borland will cooperate or if further action will be necessary. Either way, the wheels of our operation are in motion.~

@326=~Borland's Spicy Secret

Having dealt with Borland, the sense of accomplishment lingers in the air. Rigaldo's nod of approval is satisfaction enough. It seems I'm making a name for myself within the Gorgon's Eye thieves guild, and who knows what new tasks and challenges await me next.~

@327=~Order of the Black Lotus

Rigaldo, with his shrewd dealings, has managed to secure Borland's spice supplier. Now, he entrusts me with five pounds of the coveted black lotus for its first delivery at the Nashkel Carnival. The buyer is located in the eastern-most tent. As I hold it, I can sense the weight of influence it carries in the underworld trade. This successful acquisition will undoubtedly bolster our standing, drawing more lucrative ventures our way. The calculated moves we make now will set the stage for even greater triumphs in the future. ~

@328=~Order of the Black Lotus

The Flaming Fist proved to be a formidable obstacle, demanding a hefty bribe of one pound of black lotus for safe passage. It was a costly but necessary expense to ensure the success of this operation.~

@329=~Order of the Black Lotus

A tense encounter with the Flaming Fist took a violent turn when they discovered my illicit cargo of black lotus. Faced with no other choice, I had to resort to lethal force to ensure my escape. It was a grim necessity, but the operation could not afford to be compromised.~

@330=~Order of the Black Lotus

With the successful delivery of the black lotus, I now carry a substantial sum of coin back to the guild. Rigaldo will be pleased with the outcome, and our standing in the underworld trade will only strengthen.~

@331=~Order of the Black Lotus

After securing the gold from the black lotus transaction, I returned it to Rigaldo. He, in his usual fashion, offered his appreciation in the form of a well-deserved reward. ~

@332=~Order of the Black Lotus

Rigaldo's sending me on an odd task. He wants me to find Pruflas, deep in the easternmost black lotus tent at the Nashkel Carnival. From what I've heard, it's a den of haze and vice, not a place I'd willingly step into. My job? Convince Pruflas to leave this pit and return to his worried wife. Time to gather my resolve and see if I can talk some sense into him. Afterwards, back to Rigaldo with the news.~

@333=~Order of the Black Lotus

It seems the buyer won't do business until Pruflas is out of the picture. Looks like I have no choice but to convince him, one way or another. This may not be a simple chat and persuasion job. I need to be prepared for anything, and I can't rule out that things may get rough. But there's no turning back now. The Guild expects results.~

@334=~Order of the Black Lotus

To my surprise, Pruflas expressed his desire to find clarity amidst the haze of the black lotus. He looked to me for assistance, and so, I carefully administered a dose that seemed to grant him a moment of profound insight. As the fog lifted, he left the tent, his eyes shining with a newfound understanding, and he spoke of reuniting with his wife. It was a remarkable turn of events, driven by Pruflas's own wish for transformation.~

@335=~Order of the Black Lotus

A tragic turn of events unfolded as I attempted to assist Pruflas in finding clarity amidst the haze of the black lotus. Regrettably, my hand slipped, and he received a dose far too potent. His body couldn't withstand the intensity, and he succumbed to the overwhelming effects. This serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that come with the path we tread in the world of shadows and intrigue.~

@336=~Order of the Black Lotus

A sigh of relief escapes me as I step back into the dusky embrace of the Gorgon's Eye hideout. Convincing Pruflas was no small feat, but the weight of Rigaldo's coin purse in my hand reminds me of the rewards that await those who navigate the intricate web of shadows. The task is done, and I can only hope that Pruflas finds solace in reuniting with his wife. For now, I shall count my earnings and prepare for the next chapter of this clandestine dance.~

@337=~Order of the Black Lotus

I returned to the Gorgon's Eye hideout, the weight of Pruflas's fate resting lightly on my conscience. It was an unfortunate outcome, but truth be told, I can't summon much regret for his passing. In our line of work, such incidents are an occupational hazard. Rigaldo's disappointment was to be expected, but it doesn't trouble me much. Onward I go, for the shadows offer no respite for the hesitant.~

          ///////// Liedel's Quests /////////
          ///////////////////////////////////
          

@410=~Liedel's Bounty: Carth

Liedel informed me of a man named Carth who has run afoul of the Zhentarim. He's failed to meet his debt obligations, and now there's a bounty on his head. I'll need to scour the inns and taverns north of the Coast Way to track him down. This won't be an easy task, but the reward for bringing him in should make it worthwhile. Time to hit the road.~

@411=~Liedel's Bounty: Carth

Carth proved to be no match for my skills. I tracked him down to the Friendly Arm Inn, where he was holed up in a room. Dispatching him was swift and without incident. Now, it's time to collect my reward from Liedel. ~

@412=~Liedel's Bounty: Carth

Carth, the man with the bounty on his head, was cowering in a room at the Friendly Arm Inn. Instead of carrying out the contract, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for him. I ended up giving him 300 gold coins to clear his debt and remove the target on his back. Now, it's time to face Liedel and let her know about my decision. This may not have been the way of a typical bounty hunter, but sometimes, compassion takes precedence.~

@413=~Liedel's Bounty: Carth

After successfully tracking down Carth, I collected the bounty for his capture, which amounted to 500 gold coins. It's a rewarding feeling to see justice served and receive compensation for my efforts.~

@414=~Liedel's Bounty: Carth

Liedel already received word that the bounty was removed. Carth must have managed to make it past the kitchens this time.~

@415=~Liedel's Bounty: Vapula Simberg 

There is a bounty on a rogue named Vapula Simberg. He testified against his fellow guildmates in Baldur's Gate and went into hiding shortly thereafter. I should look for him at any temples that I come across.~

@416=~Liedel's Bounty: Vapula Simberg

I found Vapula at the Temple of Lathander in Beregost. I had to fight him in what he called a, "trial by combat under the eyes of the gods". The gods must have favored me because I was able to kill him. I should return his pendant to Liedel as proof that he is dead.~

@417=~Liedel's Bounty: Vapula Simberg

I found Vapula at the Temple of Lathander in Beregost. He turned from a life of crime into a life of piousness and I chose not to kill him over that. He gave me his pendant to bring back so that his aggressors will think him dead, making him free to wander the land, atoning for his sins.~

@418=~Liedel's Bounty: Vapula Simberg 

I returned Vapula's pendant to Liedel and was given 500 gold coins as a reward.~

@419=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha 

There is a bounty on a courtesan named Aisha. It seems she's taken refuge in Beregost, lacking both family and funds to escape. I'll need to scour the town and locate her discreet hideout.~

@420=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha 

Aisha's life has been ended, as per Liedel's instructions. It was a necessary action to claim the bounty. I'll now make my way back to Liedel to collect my well-earned reward. There's no room for sentimentality in this line of work.~

@421=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha

Before I make any final decisions about Aisha's fate, I want to speak with the man who placed the bounty, Amrius. He can be found at The Burning Wizard in Beregost. It's crucial to understand the full story before taking any action.~

@422=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha

Amrius won't be bothering Aisha anymore. I should go and inform her of the news. It's a relief to know she can finally find some peace.~

@423=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha

Aisha was so grateful for my help that she gave me a reward. It's good to see that some people still appreciate kindness in this world. I'll go inform Liedel about what transpired.~

@424=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha

I had a conversation with Liedel and she informed me that Aisha's bounty has been officially called off by Amrius. It seems justice has been served in a different way this time.~

@425=~Liedel's Bounty: Aisha

I relayed to Liedel that Aisha's life was ended by my hand. In return, she gave me a sum of 500 gold coins as my reward. A successful chapter in the life of a bounty hunter.~

@426=~Liedel's Bounty: Europea

Liedel has tasked me with finding an escaped slave named Europea. She fled into the western woods beyond Beregost. If I manage to return her alive, the reward will be doubled. If, unfortunately, she meets her end, her slave collar will serve as proof of my success. It's time to begin the hunt.~

@427=~Liedel's Bounty: Europea

I tracked down Europea, but it seems another group of bounty hunters had beaten me to her. After a skirmish, I emerged victorious. Europea, barely clinging to life, mentioned something about a castle in the north. It's possible that this place holds clues about her past before becoming a slave.~

@428=~Liedel's Bounty: Europea

The castle Europea mentioned turned out to be the Friendly Arm Inn. The moment we arrived, the temple cleric recognized her. She carefully removed her slave collar, a symbol of her painful past. With this collar in hand, I'll be able to claim my reward and put an end to the bounty on her head. Another job done.~

@429=~Liedel's Bounty: Europea

Returning Europea's slave collar to Liedel felt like a weight off my shoulders. The reward was just a bonus; the real satisfaction came from knowing she's now in safer hands, hidden away from those who sought to harm her.~

@430=~Liedel's Bounty: Europea

Turning in Europea alive, albeit under duress, granted me double the usual reward. It's a grim path, but these are the choices I've made. The shadows grow deeper, and the weight of my decisions presses on.~

@431=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

Liedel informed me of a bounty on a dryad named Katreda causing unrest in the Larswood. The hunters are desperate for a solution. I must decide whether to persuade her to leave or to take more drastic measures. The choice ahead weighs heavy on my conscience.~

@432=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

Katreda left me with no choice but to end her life. The hunters' peace comes at a high cost, and I hope it was worth it. I should return to Liedel and inform her of the outcome.~

@433=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

Liedel now knows that Katreda's threat has been put to an end. She rewarded me with the usual sum of 500 gold coins. It's a grim business, but one that must be done.~

@434=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

I've chosen to stand with Katreda and fight against the hunters. They're not far, just to the south. It's time to put an end to their interference.~

@435=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

The hunters have been dealt with. I'll make my way back to Katreda and let her know the threat has been neutralized.~

@436=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

Katreda expressed her gratitude by gifting me a magical amulet. It seems my choice to aid her has not gone unrewarded. I'll keep this amulet close – it may prove useful on my future endeavors.~

@437=~Liedel's Bounty: Katreda

The bounty on Katreda is now considered resolved. This partnership with the dryad may have unforeseen benefits down the line. It's always good to have powerful allies.~

@438=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

A necromancer by the name of Zhontac is looking for corpses to practice his magic on. He can be found during the night, prowling about in his backyard on the eastern part of Beregost.~

@439=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

Zhontac, the necromancer, has an unsavory request for me. He's asked me to eliminate a man named Magnus, who frequents the southern fountains in Beregost during daylight hours. Zhontac wants me to bring back Magnus's lifeless body for his grim experiments. ~

@440=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

I couldn't bring myself to fulfill Zhontac's morbid request. Instead, I took matters into my own hands and ended his twisted existence. I'll need to report this to Liedel and let her know that this particular bounty is no longer a concern.~

@441=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

Magnus met his end at my hands, and now I must deliver his lifeless form to Zhontac. I'll meet the necromancer in his backyard after nightfall as he requested. This grim task may be unsettling, but it's what I agreed to.~

@442=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

Today, I found myself facing a moral crossroads. Instead of becoming an accomplice to murder, I chose to warn Magnus about Zhontac's dark intentions. It's a small act of defiance against the darkness that seems to seep into every corner of this world. I hope he finds safety in his newfound knowledge. Now, I must figure out my next move.~

@443=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

After much contemplation, I decided to let Zhontac continue his research. It's a morally gray decision, but if his experiments bear fruit, they might lead to breakthroughs that could benefit many. The line between right and wrong seems to blur in this world of shadows and secrets. Only time will tell if this was the right choice.~

@444=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

I spoke with Liedel about my decision regarding Zhontac. She seemed surprised, perhaps even a bit taken aback. Yet, for me, it felt like the right choice. In this world of shadows and uncertainties, sometimes we must make decisions that challenge our moral compass.~

@445=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

Today marked the completion of Zhontac's twisted request. Not only did I bring him what he desired, but I also collected his own bounty, to boot. It's a grim reminder of the dark paths one can tread in this world. The double reward, however, will not go to waste. Every coin is a step towards securing my own future in these treacherous times.~

@446=~Liedel's Bounty: Zhontac

Today, I reported back to Liedel with news of Zhontac's demise. I couldn't bring myself to fulfill his gruesome request, sparing the now furtunate soul. Liedel seemed content with the outcome, and handed me the standard 500 gold coin reward. It's a somber reminder that sometimes, our choices in this world are bound by shades of grey.~

          ///////// Ariosh's Quests /////////
          ///////////////////////////////////



@509=~Shadows of Revelry

After facing Ariosh's disappointment, it's clear I need to step up my game. Tonight's job was a botched mess, and it's a bitter pill to swallow. The guard came down on me like a storm, and I left empty-handed, heart pounding in my chest. No more room for slip-ups. I can practically feel the shadows scoffing at my lack of finesse. Time to turn this around, hone my skills, and ensure the next job yields the prize we seek.~

@510=~Shadows of Revelry

Tonight's task is set, and it's a delicate one. Ariosh has entrusted me with the mission to infiltrate the grand party outside the Jovial Juggler. The targets, a Lady and a Lord, both laden with coin for their journey to the Nashkel Carnival. Stealth and diversion will be my allies. The guard, sharp-eyed and vigilant, won't make straight pickpocketing an option. I'll have to rely on my wits and the skills honed through years of practice.~

@511=~Shadows of Revelry

I successfully persuaded the barkeep to start offering hard spirits to the guests. This newfound indulgence might just be the ticket to create a diversion, capitalizing on any ensuing rowdiness~

@512=~Shadows of Revelry

I convinced the enchanting courtesan to draw the guard away, but time is of the essence. This fleeting moment might afford me the chance to snatch just one of those coveted coin purses. I must act swiftly and choose wisely before the window of opportunity slams shut.~

@513=~Shadows of Revelry

I successfully provoked an angry drunk, inciting a massive brawl. Now is the perfect moment to seize the opportunity amidst the chaos and make my move on one of the nobles. Given what I've gathered about the Lady, there's a chance she might inadvertently drop something valuable herself.~

@514=~Shadows of Revelry

As I handed over the solitary purse to Ariosh, I could sense a hint of disappointment in his eyes. Though I hadn't met his expectations this time, there was a glint of understanding. He knew the unpredictability of the streets. There will always be another opportunity.~

@515=~Shadows of Revelry

Ariosh's eyes widened with satisfaction as I unveiled both purses, evidence of my deft skills in the art of thievery. He nodded in approval, acknowledging my success with a knowing grin. Tonight, the rogue in me earned its keep.~

@516=~Blades in the Night

My task is to act as bait for a band of independent rogues causing havoc in our territory. They've become a troublesome presence that we need eliminated. I've been instructed to rendezvous with them at the northern gardens after sunset. Once they strike, I have options on how to handle them. I must ensure they never dare to steal from us again and stay out of our territory, even if it means permanently removing them. This is a mission not to be taken lightly, and the success of our guild may depend on it.~

@517=~Blades in the Night

Tonight, the shadows bore witness to a grim dance. Blackthorn and his crew chose the path of resistance. Blades clashed, but the outcome was inevitable. Their reign of thievery in Beregost has come to a permanent halt.~

@518=~Blades in the Night

Through silvered tongues and careful words, I managed to convince Blackthorn and his lot to pack up and seek fortune elsewhere. The district's a bit quieter now, as they won't be causing any more trouble. A new chapter awaits them, far from the cobbled streets of Beregost.~

@519=~Blades in the Night

In a turn of events, Blackthorn decided to cast his lot with the Gorgon's Eye. The prospect of our guild's reach and influence seemed to lure him in. He's one of us now, a rogue under the Gorgon Eye's banner. His skills will surely prove invaluable in the shadows.~

@520=~Blades in the Night

Ariosh was pleased with the outcome of the mission. The streets have been reshaped according to the Gorgon's Eye's will. Our influence grows stronger with each passing day.~

@521=~Moonlit Retrieval

Ariosh's latest endeavor requires the finesse of a cat and the cunning of a fox. I am to retrieve valuable loot hidden in various spots across the city. Each location demands a different approach, the crate near the southern fountain to the barrel below the northern gardens, and finally, the sack next to the Smithy. Patience and precision will be my closest allies. I must move in the cover of night, avoiding the ever-watchful eye of the City Watch. Failure is not an option. The spoils will return to the Gorgon's Eye, or I may find myself on the wrong side of this shadows' game.~

@522=~Moonlit Retrieval

Got caught by the Watch, but managed to sweet-talk my way out of it. Can't be too careless out here. Need to stay sharp and finish this mission. The streets are crawling with danger, but that's where I thrive.~

@523=~Moonlit Retrieval

Mission complete. The loot's secured, and I reported back to Ariosh. He seemed pleased, but I'm concerned about the ripple effect this might have. The night's not without its scars, but we've come out on top. On to the next task.~

@524=~Shadows and Echoes

Ariosh gave me a new mission tonight. There's a traitor in the guild, leaking information to the City Watch. I need to drop a forged message in a barrel behind the Burning Wizard, then wait by the southern fountains at night. Ariosh made it clear, no half-measures. The traitor must be dealt with.~

@525=~Shadows and Echoes

The note's been placed at the drop spot. It's a waiting game now. I'll lay low and return to the southern fountains when the moon's high. This city feels different at night, like it's alive with secrets and shadows.~

@526=~Shadows and Echoes

Valera, the name still echoes in the night air. Turns out she was the turncoat, a face I barely recognized from the shadows of the guild. There's no room for betrayal in our line of work. It's a harsh reality, but survival demands it. This night offered no mercy.~

@527=~Shadows and Echoes

Ariosh didn't mince words. 'Nothin' left for her now but shadows and echoes,' he said. He's right. Loose ends can be deadly. We did what had to be done for the guild. This city's a beast, and we've got to be its master, or it'll consume us all.~

@528=~Street Levies

Ariosh has tasked me with collecting protection money from four establishments in Beregost: Feldpost's, The Burning Wizard, Red Sheaf, and the Jovial Juggler. Each place is expected to cough up a hefty sack of coin. I'll need to use my wits, and if necessary, a bit of muscle to ensure they comply. As I make my way through the list, I'll know that refusal is not an option. Best not to keep Ariosh waiting.~

@529=~Street Levies

The Feldpost's Inn, while not thrilled, parted with the guild dues. No fuss, no muss. The barkeep knew better than to cross paths with the Gorgon's Eye. It was a necessary transaction, one that left an invisible mark on the inn's reputation. Another step in securing the guild's influence over Beregost.~

@530=~Street Levies

I confronted the Burning Wizard's barkeep, who claims a bloke dressed as a Gorgon's Eye member already made off with the fee and disappeared through the back. He'd better not be feedin' me a load of cobblers, or he'll be singin' a different tune.~

@531=~Street Levies

Found the fool out back, thinkin' he could outfox the Gorgon's Eye. Ended his little caper swiftly and soundly. A lesson for any other would-be troublemakers who dare cross our path.~

@532=~Street Levies

Tracked down the cheeky pilferer lurkin' out back. With a bit of artful persuasion, managed to make him part ways with the ill-gotten bag. Seems he didn't reckon on tanglin' with the Gorgon's Eye.~

@533=~Street Levies

I decided to show a bit of leniency at the Red Sheaf. Times have been tough, and the barkeep's struggling to make ends meet. I warned him, though - the Gorgon's Eye won't tolerate another missed payment. He'd better get his act together or face the consequences.~

@534=~Street Levies

I made an example out of the barkeep at the Red Sheaf. He thought he could cheat the Gorgon's Eye and get away with it. The message is clear now - cross us, and you pay with your life. It might be harsh, but it's the only way to maintain our reputation in these parts.~

@535=~Street Levies

Made my way to the Jovial Juggler, and the barkeep there seemed more on edge than most. Managed to collect the dues without much fuss, which is how it should be. Loyalty to the Eye keeps things smooth. Reminded him to keep up with the payments, or else we might have a problem on our hands. Time to move on.~

@536=~Street Levies

I collected the dues, but it wasn't without a hitch. The Red Sheaf fell short, and I had to make a choice. Sent a message, one way or another. Sometimes, you have to be decisive to keep the coin flowing. The streets of Beregost are a harsh place, but that's the way of things in this trade.~

@537=~Shadows of Deception

The task is set, eliminate the inspector. This won't be a dance in the shadows; it's a strike into the heart of danger. His presence threatens the Gorgon's Eye, and my blade is the answer. I'll need to move with utmost stealth and seize the opportune moment to end his reign. Failure is not an option, and the shadows shall be my ally in this grim endeavor. The rendezvous point is in the eastern part of town, after dark, a place where the night's cloak wraps itself tightly around the alleys and corners.~

@538=~Shadows of Deception

The streets of Beregost seem to grow darker with each passing day. Tonight, I found myself in the midst of an intricate plan devised by the cunning Inspector. His schemes are far from conventional, but they are effective. The decoy lay dead at my feet, a mere pawn in this elaborate game. The Inspector's words echoed in my mind, a reminder that he is not a man to be trifled with. His grasp on the city and the Watch is firm, and he has hunted our mole within their ranks. I must tread carefully, for the noose tightens around the Gorgon's Eye. As the night cloaks the town, I should return to our hideout. The shadows whisper secrets, and I must prepare for the storm that looms on the horizon. The Inspector's threats linger, a promise of the reckoning that awaits us. The Gorgon's Eye must stand strong, for our time of trial is swiftly approaching.~

@539=~Shadows of Deception

The Inspector played us like a fiddle. The meeting was a trap to uncover our mole, and it worked. It's a dark day for our comrade in the Watch; they'll face unimaginable horrors. We have to be doubly cautious now. The stakes have been raised, and we can't afford any more slip-ups. The Gorgon's Eye won't go down without a fight, that much is certain. We'll need to be sharper and deadlier than ever before. It's a grim game we're playing, but there's no turning back now.~

@540=~Shrouded Alliances

Ariosh has set a new path for me, one that leads to Baldur's Gate and a rendezvous with Black Lily, a name that carries weight in the thieving circles of the city. It's a curious alliance, but Ariosh seems to have a certain respect for her, hinting at a history beyond our immediate interests. I'm to gather intelligence on the Inspector, the Flaming Fist's heavy-hitter who's causing turmoil in Beregost. The mission is weighty, and the outcome could shift the tides in our favor. The destiny of the Gorgon's Eye hangs, in part, on the information I'm set to acquire from Black Lily. Here's to hoping she lives up to her reputation.~

@541=~Shrouded Alliances

I met with Black Lily, a skilled contact in Baldur's Gate. She provided some valuable intel on Inspector Branic, the thorn in our side. It seems he has a weakness for a certain type of girl, and Black Lily pointed us to Ishani, a courtesan who might be just the key we need. She can be found at the Blade and Stars in southeast Baldur's Gate. She also mentioned a rare whiskey, from the Moonshae Isles, which the Inspector takes a particular liking too. I can find it for sale at the docks, in a place called Jopalin's Tavern. Time to make our move.~

@542=~Shrouded Alliances

I was able to find Ishani, an enterprising young courtesan with a taste for the finer things. She's offered her assistance in handling Inspector Branic in Beregost, but not without a price. Ishani desires a necklace worn by Lady Eleanor, a friend of Brilla Silvershield. This task will surely be perilous, given the heavy guard presence. But with the necklace in hand, Ishani is willing to lend her skills for our operation against the Inspector. Time to take some risks and embark on this dangerous endeavor.~

@543=~Shrouded Alliances

Ishani was thrilled to see the Moonlit Cascade. She was utterly mesmerized by its beauty and craftsmanship. It's clear this necklace holds a special place in her heart. This should make our plan all the more convincing. With her charm and this exquisite piece, the Inspector won't stand a chance.~

@544=~Shrouded Alliances

I managed to secure a bottle of the rare Moonshae whiskey from Jopalin's Tavern. This particular spirit has a reputation for being the Inspector's favorite, and it'll serve as the perfect bait to lure him into our trap. With this, we're one step closer to reclaiming Beregost from his grasp.~

@545=~Shrouded Alliances

Ariosh's plan at the Jovial Juggler is set in motion. I'm to deliver the Moonshae whiskey to the barkeep and inform him to send for the Inspector. Ishani will spin a tale of desperation, claiming that she was forced to work for the gang and now seeks to turn the tables. With her beguiling charm and quick wit, she aims to divert the Inspector's attention and persuade him to partake of the poisoned whiskey. Once he takes a sip, the undetectable toxin will do its work. I must remain vigilant, ready to step in if anything goes awry. This is our chance to rid Beregost of this plague, and we can't afford any missteps. It's time to face the Inspector head-on and bring justice to our guild.~

@546=~Shrouded Alliances

Ariosh has handed me an incendiary device, a last-resort plan in case things go south at the Jovial Juggler. He emphasized the severity of its consequences, collateral damage would be high, and anyone in the vicinity might not survive. It's a grim reminder of the high stakes we're playing for. This device will be used to threaten the bartender and blow the place up if the Inspector doesn't take the bait. It's a dangerous game, but one that we may be forced to play.~

@547=~Shrouded Alliances

The plan unfolded with a dangerous elegance. The Inspector fell for the trap, sipping from the poisoned chalice, unaware of the fate he sealed. It wasn't long before his strength waned, and he met his end. Our grip on Beregost tightens, and the Gorgon's Eye stands stronger than ever. The Commander will surely retaliate, but we are prepared for the storm that awaits. Victory tastes sweet, even amidst the shadows.~

@548=~Shrouded Alliances

I couldn't bear to stick to the plan. The rage and need for revenge took over. I confronted the Inspector directly, and a brutal fight ensued. It was a bloodbath, both him and the City Watch accompanying him met their end at my hands. The original plan was shattered, and the Jovial Juggler now holds its memories. I must report back to Ariosh, no matter the outcome. There may be consequences for this deviation from the plan, but for now, vengeance is mine.~

@549=~Shrouded Alliances

The explosion echoed through the Jovial Juggler, a maelstrom of fire and destruction. The Inspector, along with Ishani and numerous innocent bystanders, were engulfed in the inferno. The plan had succeeded, but at a terrible cost. As I stand amidst the smoking ruins, a chilling realization settles in - perhaps I went too far.~

@550=~Shrouded Alliances

The plan at the Jovial Juggler took a sharp turn. The Inspector saw through our ruse, claiming to have "eyes and ears everywhere." It was clear he sensed the trap. A brawl ensued, desperate and brutal. In the end, it was I who prevailed. The Inspector now lies lifeless, and Beregost is grimly reminded of our rule. I must return to Ariosh to deliver the report and determine our next move. The Gorgon's Eye will not rest until the city is cleansed of all those who stand in our way.~

@551=~Shrouded Alliances

In the aftermath of our operation, the Inspector lies dead, a clear signal of our determination. The Watch, once a united force, now grapples with internal strife and doubt, as our influence takes root. Commander Seraphina Whitewood stands as the final obstacle in our path to power. With the Inspector's demise, Beregost is now a city teetering on the edge of change, and the Gorgon's Eye continues its inexorable march toward dominance.~

@552=~Shadows of the Valkyrie

Ariosh has set a new task before me, one that carries a sense of gravity even within the dark corridors of the Gorgon's Eye. The Valkyrie twins, Clare and Theresa, have become key obstacles. They wield divine power, their influence stretching through the city's underbelly. Eliminating them is not merely a matter of skill, but of finesse and secrecy. It's a delicate dance, this one, and failure would mean exposing our guild to risks too great to imagine.~

@553=~Shadows of the Valkyrie

Clare's death did not come without a price. The element of surprise was tarnished, a lesson etched in the shadows. In this deadly dance, perfection is demanded, and any lapse could be the end. I must hone my skills further, refine my approach, if I am to navigate the shadows without leaving a trace.~

@554=~Shadows of the Valkyrie

Theresa's life was extinguished, but not in deafened secrecy. The battle that ensued was fierce, her gruff exterior masking a strength I hadn't anticipated. The mission was a success, and she now rests in eternal silence. Ariosh may find some satisfaction, but in the cutthroat world we dwell, excellence is our only currency. There's no room for error.~

@555=~Shadows of the Valkyrie

The twins, once forces to be reckoned with, now lie vanquished. Ariosh's satisfaction is apparent, but he's right - the path ahead is fraught with even darker shadows. The City Watch teeters on the brink of chaos, and we are the architects of its downfall. Word of their deaths has already begun to spread through the darkened streets. The Gorgon's Eye has proven its might once again, but there is no room for complacency. With each mission, I delve deeper into the heart of darkness, knowing that our guild's survival relies on our cunning and the shadows that shelter us. Whitewood will meet her end in this darkness.~

@556=~Divided Loyalties

The ranks of the Watch have fractured, a mutiny kindled by the calculated assassinations of their heirarchy. Chaos reigns in Beregost's streets, a scene of bitter struggle. Baldwin and Ariosh seized upon this turmoil as opportunity. The Temple, a bastion of refuge for Commander Whitewood, now stands as our final destination. It is here that our destiny intertwines with the City Watch's fate. The moment of reckoning draws nigh, as we prepare to sever the head of this serpentine conflict.~

@557=~Divided Loyalties

The battle was fierce, and the Temple of Lathander now bears the scars of our clash. Commander Seraphina Whitewood, once the stalwart defender of Beregost, now lies defeated at my feet, along with her loyal Templar Knights. With Whitewood gone, the Gorgon's Eye can tighten its grip on the city, solidifying our dominance. The echoes of our struggle will forever reverberate through the hallowed halls of the temple, a testament to our strength and determination.~

@558=~Divided Loyalties

Tonight, I stand at the pinnacle of shadows, having carved my path through Beregost's twisting alleys and dark secrets. The City Watch lies fractured, the Gorgon's Eye asserts its dominion, and the Temple of Lathander bears witness to the fall of Commander Seraphina Whitewood. Ariosh's trust in me has been well-placed; I am a true thief, forged in the crucible of back-alley intrigue and high-stakes heists. The streets are mine, and the city will remember the name, <CHARNAME> of the Gorgon's Eye.~

@610=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

Gilbald informed me of a concerning matter: the possible infiltration of counterfeit gold into the Gorgon's Eye. He has tasked me with the responsibility of investigating this issue. To start, I need to speak with his gamesmen, hoping to unravel the mysteries of that fateful night. The shadows may hold the key, and it is my duty to unlock their secrets.~

@611=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

According to the gamesmen, there were three individuals who drew their attention last night. Among them was Xevec, a beggar from Beregost who seemed out of place in this environment. Then, there was a woman dressed modestly, yet she carried herself with an air of nobility. She spoke of a daughter named Sam, though the girl wasn't present. Finally, there was Hugo, a one-handed dwarf whose presence intrigued the onlookers. The gamesmen recommended starting my investigation with Meredia, as she might possess valuable insights, particularly concerning Xevec.~

@612=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

Meredia confirmed that Xevec indeed used counterfeit gold at her establishment. She described him as not particularly astute and prone to falling for various business scams. According to her, Xevec is convinced that his latest job offer will bring him wealth, and he's been given an upfront payment as a show of faith. I should be able to locate him on the streets of Beregost.~

@613=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

I located Xevec, who explained that he unwittingly used the counterfeit coins, receiving them as payment for a contract to eliminate a young woman named Sam residing in Nashkel. He mentioned that the woman who hired him appeared to have a close connection with Sam and might reside in the same area.~

@614=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

I opted to eliminate Xevec upon confirming his involvement with the counterfeit gold. I should now report back to Gilbald and apprise him of the situation.~

@615=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

Gilbald rewarded me handsomely for handling the situation with Xevec. While there might have been more to his story, I deemed it best to make an example of him. The case seemed straightforward, so I saw no need for further inquiry.~

@616=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

It appears Xevec was telling the truth. He was hired by Samantha's maid to carry out the deed. I took matters into my own hands and ended her life for her involvement. Now, it's time to pay Xevec another visit.~

@617=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

It appears Xevec was telling the truth. He was hired by Samantha's maid to carry out the deed. I chose not to take her life, but I should pay Xevec another visit to gather more information.~

@618=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

After my conversation with Xevec, I chose not to end his life. Instead, I'll need to report my findings to Gilbald. Ultimately, it will be up to him to determine the next course of action.~

@619=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

After successfully resolving the situation with Xevec and the maid, Gilbald expressed his gratitude and handed over a substantial reward. It's moments like these that remind me why I'm in this line of work; there's a certain satisfaction in tying up loose ends and ensuring justice is served, even in the underworld.~

@620=~The Case of the Counterfeit Coins

Samantha's mother confided in me, revealing that the maid not only took a necklace but she suspects there might be more missing. Oddly, her concern seemed more directed towards the stolen jewelry than her daughter's safety. There's a palpable tension between the maid and Samantha, and it's clear there's more to this story than meets the eye. This revelation adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex situation. Perhaps the key lies within the confines of the maid, herself.~

          //////// Meredia's Quests /////////
          ///////////////////////////////////


@710=~Escort the Escort

Meredia has expressed deep concern for one of her girls, Ilena, who hasn't returned from her business last night. The worry is palpable in Meredia's eyes. It appears that Ilena was lodging with a man named Isley in a house adjacent to the Thunderhammer Smithy in Beregost. This situation raises questions about Ilena's safety and what transpired during her evening with Isley.~

@711=~Escort the Escort

Upon arriving at the house where Ilena was staying, I was met with a grim scene. Isley's wife lay dying on the floor, her words strained and filled with anguish. She uttered that her husband was the perpetrator before she succumbed to her wounds. Inside the house, I discovered a red piece of cloth and a helmet stained with blood. These haunting clues hint at a tragedy that unfolded within these walls. Now, it is imperative that I return to the Gorgon's Eye hideout and relay this distressing news to Meredia.~

@712=~Escort the Escort

Meredia's deduction about Isley's military background based on the cloth and helmet seems plausible. To gather more information, I'll need to identify the specific uniform he wears. This could potentially lead me to Isley and unveil more details about the unsettling events that transpired.~

@713=~Escort the Escort

I confronted Isley, but tragically, I couldn't prevent him from taking Ilena's life. It's a devastating loss. Now, I must gather the strength to break this heart-wrenching news to Meredia.~

@714=~Escort the Escort

I managed to defeat Isley, sparing Ilena in the process. She's now on her way back to Beregost. I'll follow suit, eager to share the news with Meredia, who I'm sure will be relieved to hear of the outcome.~

@715=~Escort the Escort

The courtesans were overjoyed that I managed to rescue Ilena, and they generously pooled their resources to offer me a reward. It was a heartwarming gesture, to say the least.~

@716=~Escort the Escort

Meredia was deeply saddened by the news of Ilena's passing. It's hard not to feel a weight of responsibility for what happened.~

          ///////// Procus's Quests /////////
          ///////////////////////////////////


@809=~Foundations of Intrigue

Before setting off for Nashkel, it might be worth having a chat with Liedel and Gilbald. Liedel's got some new bounties to share, and Rigaldo mentioned he sensed something amiss with Gilbald's men at the casino. Rigaldo's next directive has set our sights on the Nashkel Carnival, a bustling haven for potential opportunities. I should meet with Procus by the jousting lists, a crucial contact for establishing our presence. The prospect of a new operational center in the heart of the carnival is an exciting step forward. It's imperative that we proceed with caution, as this venture into Nashkel's territory will undoubtedly pose its own set of challenges.~

@810=~Foundations of Intrigue

I've met with Procus, the Thieves Guild contact in Nashkel. He explained that our objective here is to expand the guild's influence in this quiet town on the outskirts of Amn. Our first step is to secure a base of operations, which currently resides in the form of a tent occupied by a stubborn merchant. I have several options: negotiate a peaceful departure, use intimidation to convince him to leave, or, if necessary, resort to force.~

@811=~Foundations of Intrigue

Securing the tent demands a hefty investment, necessitating the acquisition of 500 gold. This substantial sum is a prerequisite to obtain his entire stock. It is a considerable task, yet a necessary one, for without it, our foothold in this new territory remains uncertain. The challenge lies in accumulating the necessary funds.~

@812=~Foundations of Intrigue

The merchant's presence has been dealt with, and the tent now stands vacant, awaiting our occupation. With the obstacle removed, we are poised to establish our base of operations in this strategic location. The path we tread is not without its sacrifices, and I can only hope it proves worthwhile.~

@813=~Foundations of Intrigue

Having successfully returned to Procus, the final steps towards our goal are in sight. With the groundwork laid, we stand on the precipice of claiming the tent as our base of operations. The details are to be finalized, and preparations are underway for the moment we officially establish our presence in this new territory.~

@814=~Foundations of Intrigue

As I set forth on Procus' task, the weight of the situation hangs heavy in the air. The northern shadows of the lotus tent, conceal the freelancing rogues I'm meant to recruit. Among them, the renowned Selene Stardancer, a name that carries tales of daring exploits from the Pirate Isles. My objective is clear: persuade them that our venture offers more than their current wayward pursuits. The task ahead is not without its challenges, but I must remember that every footpad has a price, every swashbuckler a secret ambition. This is a crucial step in expanding our dominion, and I will approach it with utmost caution and cunning.~

@815=~Foundations of Intrigue

The negotiations with Captain Stardancer and her crew took an unexpected turn. Despite my attempts to convince them, it seems they were determined to hold their ground. The clash was inevitable. It was a fierce fight, but in the end, they left me with no choice but to defend myself and ensure they no longer pose a threat to our operations in these parts. Their reputation may have been grand, but they underestimated the Gorgon's Eye.~

@816=~Foundations of Intrigue

Today, I met Captain Selena Stardancer, a renowned swashbuckler from the Pirate Isles. Her reputation preceded her, and she certainly lived up to it. Negotiations went surprisingly well, and we've struck a deal. In exchange for retrieving certain documents from the Amnian army's barracks, Selena and her crew have agreed to join forces with the Gorgon's Eye. The task ahead is not without its challenges, but securing such a skilled crew will be a significant boon to our operations. Time to gather my wits and prepare for this daring mission.~

@817=~Foundations of Intrigue

With the incriminating documents safely handed over to Selena, it seems our alliance with her and her crew is set in stone. They've agreed to meet us at our headquarters, a promising turn of events. Stardancer's boisterous crew brings a wealth of experience and skills that will undoubtedly bolster our operations. It's a calculated risk, but one that promises significant rewards. Time to prepare for our next moves and solidify our newfound partnership.~

@818=~Foundations of Intrigue

Procus has outlined our next steps for establishing our presence in Nashkel. He's identified three targets: a potion merchant at the carnival, a mansion in Nashkel, and a quiet inn. Each location holds significant potential for acquiring the necessary startup funds. It's crucial to maintain discretion and operate in the shadows, ensuring our actions go unnoticed. Once the gold is secured from all three locations, I'll return to Procus with our spoils. Time to get to work.~

@819=~Foundations of Intrigue

Procus was pleased with my performance, acknowledging that the tasks I accomplished have solidified our position in the region. The base is set, a crew is assembled, and a substantial sum of gold has been secured. I'm to report back to Rigaldo with the good news, knowing that I've played a crucial role in this endeavor~

@820=~Foundations of Intrigue

It's a satisfying feeling, knowing that our plans are bearing fruit. With the base established, a capable crew, and a significant hoard of gold, the Gorgon's Eye is poised for greater things. This success isn't just mine; it's a testament to the strength and vision of our guild. I leave Rigaldo with a sense of accomplishment, eager to face the next challenge.~
