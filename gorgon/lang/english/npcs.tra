@1000=~Well, look at you, a fresh face in our little den of shadows. Quite the promising sight, if I do say so.~
@1001=~As we stride through the shadows, it's a dance of danger and desire, and we are its masters.~
@1002=~Even shadows retreat when the light is too harsh; we must withdraw!~
@1003=~Do we merely play it safe? Where's the thrill, the danger, the intrigue?~
@1004=~I am a creature of the shadows, not of this insipid play. Change course, or lose me.~
@1005=~I'll lead us into temptation, and oh, how sweet it will be.~
@1006=~A moment to breathe, perhaps? Even seductresses need their beauty sleep.~
@1007=~Yawn... Entertain me, dear companion, or I shall find amusement elsewhere.~
@1008=~Nature, a seductive enigma, let's unravel her mysteries.~
@1009=~The pulse of civilization, a siren's song, drawing us into its passionate heart.~
@1010=~In the earth's depths, let's discover the sensuality of darkness and danger.~
@1011=~The sun unveils too much; I yearn for the night's caress.~
@1012=~As darkness envelops us, let's embrace the night's alluring touch.~
@1013=~In the night's name, we strike with deadly grace!~
@1014=~Oh, the sweet rush of impending conflict!~
@1015=~Let's mix a little pleasure with our pain, shall we?~
@1016=~Embrace the darkness; let our enemies cower before us!~
@1017=~Let's show them the might of shadows and steel!~
@1018=~So... this is the final thrill...~
@1019=~Your touch is sharp, but mine is deadly.~
@1020=~Mmm, your wish?~ 
@1021=~Speak, and I shall listen.~ 
@1022=~Oh, the possibilities...~
@1023=~What shadows shall we chase?~
@1024=~Yes, my dear?~
@1025=~I'm ready to bewitch.~
@1026=~Your desires are mine to fulfill.~
@1027=~Wrapped in shadows, it shall be done.~
@1028=~Like a whispered secret.~
@1029=~My devious pleasure.~
@1030=~Your instruction, my seductive execution.~
@1031=~Shhh... It's our little secret.~
@1032=~The night and I are eager to listen.~
@1033=~One less player in our game; may the shadows embrace you.~
@1034=~There's a quiet beauty in the chaos of the world that few pause to appreciate.~
@1035=~The stars whisper secrets of a life I might have led, in a world less cruel.~
@1036=~A perfect strike, as if kissed by the night herself!~
@1037=~The allure of the chase, heightened by a miss... Enticing.~
@1038=~You resist my touch, but let's see how you handle my... other tricks.~
@1039=~Even my pockets have their limits. No more room for trinkets... or temptations.~
@1040=~Your secrets are mine.~
@1041=~Shadows, embrace me.~
@1042=~Ah, my spell breaks like a lover's quarrel!~
@1043=~A hidden delight awaits our foes.~
@1044=~When asked about her past, LIEDEL speaks little, yet her eyes hint at a saga as complex as the streets of Selgaunt from which she emerged. She acknowledges her origin as an orphan of those ruthless alleys, where her cunning and resilience were her most valued companions. Despite the harshness of her early life, she fondly recalls her time with the Javaliens, a merchant family who recognized her potential and guided her from the gutters to the world of commerce and intrigue.

Her path eventually led her to the Scepters, Selgaunt’s city watch, where she excelled in tracking and intelligence, though the rigid confines of law soon proved too constricting. Liedel found herself drawn to the darker underbelly of the city, joining the ranks of the Night Knives. Within this infamous guild, she refined her skills, becoming a master of stealth and manipulation.

However, Liedel speaks cryptically of the events that led her to sever ties with the Night Knives – a decision marked by betrayal and a harrowing escape. It was in the shadows of this chaos that she found her way to the Gorgon's Eye, where she now pledges her allegiance. Here, she has found a sanctuary, a place where her talents in subterfuge and strategy are not only valued but celebrated.

Liedel remains a guarded figure, her true motivations wrapped in mystery. Her allegiance to the Gorgon's Eye speaks of her desire for a new beginning, yet the scars of her past life in Selgaunt’s underworld are never far from the surface. She stands now as a testament to survival and adaptability, a survivor who has turned her tumultuous past into a tool for navigating the precarious world she inhabits.~

@1050=~Shadows grace your endeavors, and now, so does the Church of Mask.~
@1051=~Even the shadows have abandoned us. We must retreat!~
@1052=~This path aligns well with our Lord's designs.~
@1053=~Your actions stray far from the teachings of Mask.~
@1054=~I cannot follow this path any longer. It leads away from the shadows.~
@1055=~Under my guidance, we shall walk the path of shadows.~
@1056=~I'm a little tired... but the nights work isn't done yet.~
@1057=~Idle hands are a thief's playground. Let's find some mischief.~
@1058=~Shadows, be my blade!~
@1059=~For the Lord of Shadows!~
@1060=~Mask, guide my hand!~
@1061=~Let the darkness be our ally!~
@1062=~Into the fray, with the stealth of night!~
@1063=~Mask... I return to your dark embrace.~
@1064=~The shadows wane... I need aid.~
@1065=~Nature's cover is akin to our own - hidden, yet full of life.~
@1066=~This city is a cloak of many colors, hiding both danger and opportunity.~
@1067=~This dungeon, a realm of darkness and mystery, is both our challenge and our ally.~
@1068=~The sun's rays strip us of our secrecy; how I long for the veil of night.~
@1069=~As night falls, our power grows.~
@1070=~Cloaked in darkness, I await.~
@1071=~Ready for some mischief?~
@1072=~Just point me to the shadows.~
@1073=~Whisper your needs, and I shall act.~
@1074=~From the dark, your servant awaits.~
@1075=~I am here, shadowed and silent.~
@1076=~Your will, my shadows.~
@1077=~With stealth and purpose.~
@1078=~As the shadows will it.~
@1079=~I move as Mask decrees.~
@1080=~As silent as the night.~
@1081=~With Mask's guidance.~
@1082=~Shadows, guide my hand.~
@1083=~Another secret fades into darkness.~
@1084=~In the stillness of night, I ponder - would my life have been different, had the shadows not claimed me so young?~
@1085=~Memories of Thay, a past both distant and near. Even in the heart of darkness, a flicker of what could have been still remains.~
@1086=~A shadow strikes true!~
@1087=~Missed... must've been a trick of the light.~
@1088=~They stand immune to my arts. A different approach is needed.~
@1089=~I can conceal no more within these cloaks of darkness.~
@1090=~In the shadow of Mask, I claim this prize.~
@1091=~Shrouded in shadows, I am unseen.~
@1092=~The Weave is fickle, like fate's whisper.~
@1093=~A shadow's trap, unseen, unforgiving.~
@1094=~When asked about her past, DANIKA briefly mentions her origins as a slave in the harsh realm of Thay, a detail she shares with a noticeable reluctance. She skims over the details of her early life, only revealing that a violent upheaval at her master's estate left her as the sole survivor. The nature of this event remains shrouded in mystery, much like the shadows she now reveres.

She speaks with more openness about finding refuge in a temple of Mask, where she was raised and trained in the ways of the Lord of Shadows. Danika holds her faith and the teachings of her deity in high esteem, often citing them as the guiding force in her life. Her devotion to Mask is unwavering, a dedication that saw her ascend to the rank of a Demarchess.

Danika's current path led her to the Gorgon's Eye, where she was sent by the Church to fulfill her role and extend Mask's influence. She regards this assignment with a sense of solemn duty, viewing it as a continuation of her service to the Church. Her demeanor suggests that she is more than capable of navigating the dangerous and secretive world she now inhabits.

Though reserved about her past, Danika's skills in stealth and strategy are evident. Her presence within the Gorgon's Eye speaks to her capabilities, and her faith in Mask underscores every action she takes. She remains a figure wrapped in intrigue, her true intentions known only to herself and perhaps her deity.~
