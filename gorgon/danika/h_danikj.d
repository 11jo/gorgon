/*
Im making an NPC mod for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition and need help coming up with a friendship/possibly romance track of dialog. im thinking it should have 20 conversations. here is some info on the character:

Name: Danika
Gender: Female
Class: Demarchess of Mask (Cleric/Thief)
Alignment: Lawful Evil

Background Summary:
Danika's life is a tapestry of shadows and secrets. Born a slave in the dark land of Thay, she was raised in the estate of a Red Wizard, who was secretly her father. Her early years were marked by the duality of her existence - a slave in her own father's home, treated with indifferent equality among other slaves. Her mother was also a slave there and was the only person of comfort and love in her life. Her life took a dramatic turn at the age of eight when assassins hired by a political rival of her father attacked the estate. In a miraculous eruption out of nowhere of latent magical abilities, she survived the attack and killed the assassins, becoming the sole survivor. Everyone else died including her mother. Her father was on the brink of death and called her over, revealing the secret that he is her father. then he died.

Taken in by the Temple of Mask, the very organization responsible for the massacre, Danika was trained as a Demarchess of Mask. The church was the one hired by the political rivals to kill everyone in the estate, danika included. the church has no interest in those politics it was just a job to them. Once they realized danika, a child, somehow managed to kill their highly trained assassins, they took her in after she fled and was on the streets, raising her as one of their own, but never revealing their role in the attack. Unaware of the Temple's role in her past, she honed her skills in thievery and subterfuge, guided by the tenets of Mask. Her life in the temple was a blend of rigorous training and indoctrination, shaping her into a skilled and shadowy figure.

Flaws:
Because of her upbringing as a slave and a member of the evil church of mask, danika believes in order and structure over everything, thus her lawful evil alignment.
Impulsiveness: Danika's youth and lack of a stable upbringing can sometimes lead to impulsive decisions without fully considering the consequences.
Trust Issues: Her complex past makes it difficult for her to trust others, which can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.

Personality Traits:

Cautious and Curious: Danika approaches new situations and people with a blend of caution and curiosity. Her upbringing in a world of deceit and betrayal has made her wary of others' intentions, but her innate curiosity often leads her to explore the unknown.
Shadowy Demeanor: Reflecting her training and allegiance to Mask, Danika often presents a mysterious and shadowy demeanor. She is skilled at keeping her true thoughts and emotions hidden, revealing them only when she deems it necessary.
Youthful Energy: Despite her dark past, Danika possesses a youthful energy and zest for life. She is passionate about her pursuits and often displays a certain playfulness in her interactions.
Strategic and Intelligent: Danika is highly intelligent and strategic in her thinking. She excels at planning and executing complex schemes, a skill honed through her training as a Demarchess of Mask.

Title and Role: Danika is a "Demarchess" in the Church of Mask. This title signifies a high-ranking position, and she often references her duties and training in this role. Her dialogue suggests she's adept in the subtleties of her faith and the practicalities of clandestine work.

The Church of Mask: Her dialogues provide insights into the Church of Mask, portraying it as a congregation valuing stealth, secrecy, and subtlety. The church seems to believe in the fluidity of ownership, defined more by possession than law or tradition.

Divine Guidance and Shadow: Danika sees herself as an ally and guide, infusing operations with divine purpose. She often talks about the guidance of shadows and the importance of being vigilant in a world of shifting alliances.

Secrecy and Espionage: Her training in espionage and interpreting secrets is a recurring theme. She emphasizes the importance of not sharing secrets with those uninitiated in their ways.

Guidance and Wisdom: She offers guidance and wisdom, promising to be ready to impart the wisdom of Mask. Her role as a guide is not just strategic but also spiritual, providing intuitive and subtle assistance.

Overall, Danika is portrayed as a complex character deeply rooted in her faith, valuing subtlety, cunning, and the teachings of her deity. She is cautious, secretive, and dedicated to her role within the Church of Mask, embodying the qualities revered by her faith.

Role and Alignment: Danika identifies herself as a "Demarchess of our Lord of Shadows." This title suggests she holds a significant position within the Church of Mask, a deity in the Forgotten Realms. The Lord of Shadows refers to Mask, a god known for themes of stealth, thievery, and intrigue.

Speech Style: Her dialogues are formal and somewhat cryptic, reflecting a sense of mystery and discretion typical of a follower of Mask. Phrases like "those who serve the Lord of Shadows do not share secrets with those uninitiated in our ways" and "tread carefully, for these shadows watch and remember" emphasize her secretive and cautious nature.
