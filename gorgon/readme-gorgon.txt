The Gorgon's Eyes
V.2

=======
Prequel
=======
After violating the terms of his separation from the Shadow Thieves, Baldwin
"The Butcher" Glendale, fled north to Beregost, where he formed his own guild,
the Gorgon's Eye. He pressed the local pickpockets and began amassing a vast
network of contacts and spies. The locals have begun to show signs of unrest,
however, and are making plans of their own to combat this new threat. On top of
that, the impending confrontation with the Shadow Thieves lies near on the
horizon. Currently, Baldwin is in active recruitment, seeking adventurers to
aid him in the search for a dark and powerful staff called the Kerykeion. If
successful, it would grant him unimaginable power, allowing nothing to stand in
his way.

The Gorgon's Eye is a small content mod for BG:EE/SoD and EET that adds an
underground thieves den into the town of Beregost. It contains 18 new quests,
2 new areas(reused), some new characters, a new store that buys stolen goods, a
few new items and a very small item-upgrade. It can be accessed immediately
after leaving Candlekeep and is open to all players, excluding those with a
lawful-good alignment.

This mod would not have been possible without DnD Detective's mod tutorial 
videos on YouTube. They really helped me bridge the gap between knowing
absolutely nothing about how to start a mod, to being able to create working
content. This mod would also have been completely lacking if not for all the 
gracious help I recieved from the entire G3 community, especially CamDawg, who
answered and provided reference for all my questions.
