The Gorgon's Eye
V.4.0

=======
Prequel
=======
Within the shadow-veiled alleys of Beregost, a new undercurrent of danger has begun to rise.

Once a member of the elusive Shadow Thieves, Baldwin "The Butcher" Glendale found himself ensnared
in a web of betrayal, leading to his banishment from the brotherhood he had long served. In a cold
and calculated response, he exacted his revenge, mercilessly eliminating those who had turned
against him. With the blood of his former comrades still fresh on his hands, he vanished into the
night, seeking refuge in the town of Beregost, where he would lay plans for his new reign of
terror: the Gorgon's Eye.

Under his ruthless command, he swiftly united the local pickpockets and cutthroats, building a vast
network of contacts and spies, their influence creeping through the streets like a poison. As his
enveloping shadow spread over Beregost, the city's heart beat with fear and defiance. The citizens,
tired of cowering in the darkness cast by this new threat, rose to action. The City Watch, a
militia birthed from the courage and desperation of the townsfolk, emerged as a beacon of
resistance. Funded and sanctioned by the formidable Flaming Fist, they stand ready to clash with
the growing might of the Gorgon's Eye.

Above the immediate fray, a more ominous threat still looms. The Shadow Thieves, lurking just
beyond sight, are biding their time, and waiting to unleash their own sinister retribution. As
Baldwin and the City Watch vie for control, this specter of the past threatens to plunge Beregost
into an even deeper abyss of chaos and darkness. A confrontation is inevitable, and the streets
will bear witness to a clash of hidden blades and dark ambitions.

In the midst of this brewing storm, Baldwin eyes a singular path to ascendancy. The Kerykeion, a
fabled artifact shrouded in ancient power, emerges as his beacon of salvation. With a secured path
to power now within his sights, Baldwin is openly recruiting for his cause, seeking adventures and
those with ambitious desires to join the ranks of his guild. As they rally to his banner for the
promise of power and wealth, will they prove strong enough to grasp the elusive might of the
Kerykeion, or will they merely become pawns in Baldwin's dark designs?

In this game of shadows and intrigue, only the most cunning will prevail.

Mod Overview
============
The Gorgon's Eye is a content mod for BG:EE and EET that adds an underground thieves den into the
town of Beregost. It contains new quests, characters, stores and items. The area can be accessed
immediately after leaving Candlekeep and is open to all players, excluding those with a lawful or
neutral-good alignment.

After enlisting in the Gorgon's Eye, you'll find yourself undertaking tasks that align with the
operations of a typical thieves guild. You'll be expected to engage in activities such as theft,
extortion, smuggling, bounty hunting, and assassination. However, it's worth noting that there are
some satisfying options for good and neutral-aligned players. If at any point you find the guild's
ways aren't to your liking, you have the option to switch allegiances ans aid the City Watch in a
raid against the Gorgon's Eye.

The component "Add more pickpocketable items" will distribute random treasure to generic npcs.
(Commoners, nobles, etc.)

Acknowledgements
================
This mod would not have been possible without DnD Detective's mod tutorial videos on YouTube. They
really helped me bridge the gap between knowing absolutely nothing about how to start a mod, to
being able to create working content.

I also want to give a special thanks to CamDawg and the entire G3 community, who answered and
provided reference for all my questions.
