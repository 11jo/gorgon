The Gorgon's Eye
V.4.8

============
Mod Overview
============
The Gorgon's Eye is a content mod for BG:EE and EET that adds an underground thieves den into the
town of Beregost. It contains new quests, characters, stores and items. The area can be accessed
immediately after leaving Candlekeep and is open to all players, excluding those with a lawful-good
alignment.

After enlisting in the Gorgon's Eye, you'll find yourself undertaking tasks that align with the
operations of a typical thieves guild. You'll be expected to engage in activities such as theft,
extortion, smuggling, and bounty hunting. However, it's worth noting that there are some satisfying
options for good and neutral-aligned players. If at any point you find the guild's ways aren't to
your liking, you have the option to switch allegiances and aid the City Watch in a raid against the
Gorgon's Eye.

The component "NPC Character Portraits" will let you choose how many characters you want to have
portraits.

The component "Add more pickpocketable items" will distribute random treasure to many generic npcs.
(Commoners, nobles, etc.)

Acknowledgements
================
This mod would not have been possible without DnD Detective's mod tutorial videos on YouTube. They
really helped me bridge the gap between knowing absolutely nothing about how to start a mod, to
being able to create working content.

I also want to give a special thanks to CamDawg and the entire G3 community, who answered and
provided reference for all my questions.
